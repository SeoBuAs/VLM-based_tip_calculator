**Video Caption:**  
"The bartender had the takeout order ready upon arrival. He presented the check but then delayed processing the payment for approximately ten minutes, during which time he interacted with another customer and assisted a server with a different order. After being prompted and realizing the delay, he processed the payment and offered a brief apology."

---

#### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

**a) Reliability:**  
- The bartender delayed processing the payment for about ten minutes, indicating some inefficiency. However, he eventually processed the payment correctly after being prompted.  
- No mention of order mistakes or billing errors.  
**Score:** 3 (Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation)  
*Justification:* The delay suggests some lack of confirmation or promptness, but the order was ultimately correct.

**b) Responsiveness:**  
- The delay in payment processing and interaction with other customers suggest slow response.  
- He responded after being prompted, not proactively.  
**Score:** 2 (Responds but with significant delays)  
*Justification:* The ten-minute delay and lack of proactive response indicate below-average responsiveness.

**c) Assurance:**  
- The staff explained the situation briefly (offered a brief apology), but no detailed menu explanations or confidence shown.  
- No evidence of offering premium suggestions or detailed explanations.  
**Score:** 3 (Can explain menu but lacks confidence)  
*Justification:* The apology shows some professionalism, but overall assurance is moderate.

**d) Empathy:**  
- The brief apology indicates some acknowledgment of the inconvenience, but no personalized service or emotional understanding is evident.  
**Score:** 3 (Basic friendliness but lacks personalization)  
*Justification:* The apology is minimal; no further personalized gestures are noted.

**e) Tangibles:**  
- No specific mention of cleanliness or uniform, but no negative comments either.  
- Assume standard cleanliness and tidiness.  
**Score:** 4 (Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained)  
*Justification:* No issues noted, and standard tidiness is presumed.

#### 1-2. Video Score Calculation

**Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4**  
= (3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4  
= (15) * 4  
= **60**

---

### 5. Total Score

**Total Score = 60**

---

### 6. Tip Calculation

**Service Level:**  
- The score of 60 indicates a "Normal" service level, but slightly on the lower side due to responsiveness and reliability issues.

**Country and Restaurant Type:**  
- USA, Casual dining

**Tip Range for USA Casual dining:**  
- Poor: 0-5%  
- Normal: 6-15%  
- Good: 16-20%

**Selected tipping percentage:**  
- Since the review content indicates some delays and minimal proactive service, the service is closer to "Normal" rather than "Good."  
- The score is at the lower end of "Normal," so we choose the lower end of the range.

**Final tip percentage:** 6%

**Subtotal:** $25.00

**Tip amount:**  
$25.00 * 6% = **$1.50**
