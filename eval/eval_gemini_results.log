2025-05-11 05:57:10,793 - eval_gemini - INFO - Okay, I will analyze the provided information and calculate the appropriate tip.

### Video Caption Analysis ###
The video shows a server interacting with customers in a casual dining setting in the USA. The server takes the order efficiently, offers to-go containers, provides the bill, and gives the correct change. When directly asked if the tip was appropriate, the server gave feedback and specified a percentage.

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    a) Reliability: 4
        *   **Justification:** The server handled the order, brought the correct change, and addressed the customer's questions about the tip. No errors in the order or billing were mentioned.
    b) Responsiveness: 4
        *   **Justification:** The server responded quickly and efficiently to the customer's requests and questions, as described in the caption.
    c) Assurance: 3
        *   **Justification:** The server confidently addressed the customer's question. However, it is difficult to assess the menu explanation based on the caption alone.
    d) Empathy: 3
        *   **Justification:** The server provided the necessary service, but based on the limited caption details, it is difficult to judge whether the server remembered customer preferences or offered personalized service. The server provided a factual answer and did not go above and beyond.
    e) Tangibles: 4
        *   **Justification:** The caption doesn't provide information on the tangibles. However, it can be assumed that the server's uniform was tidy, and the table settings were clean.

1-2. Video Score Calculation
    Video Score = (4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 72

5. Total Score
    5-1. Total Score Calculation
       Total Score = 72

6. Tip Calculation
    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
        a) The service level is determined to be Good because the total score is 72, which falls within the Good range for casual dining in the USA (16-20%).
        b) Given the positive aspects in the video analysis and the restaurant setting, the tip percentage will be within the Good range for the USA in a casual dining setting, which is 15-20%. The server handled all the tasks and gave feedback on the tip. Based on the information, the server provided good service.

        Considering the information, the tip will be set near the middle of the Good range, which is 18%.
        Tip Amount = $25.00 * 0.18 = $4.50
        Total Bill = $25.00 + $4.50 = $29.50

2025-05-11 05:57:16,381 - eval_gemini - INFO - Okay, I will analyze the scenario and calculate the appropriate tip.

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria Analysis**

Based on the description provided in the Reddit post and the video caption, I will evaluate the waiter's performance based on the defined criteria.

*   **a) Reliability:** 1. The waiter's area had an item missing while the waiter was working, indicating a lapse in security or a mistake in oversight. The confrontation also led to recovering the item, demonstrating a lack of security.
    *Reason: The incident shows that the waiter's area was not reliably secured, and an item went missing. The waiter had to confront a guest to get the item back. This indicates a low level of reliability.*
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3. The waiter was responsive to the situation by investigating the missing item, though the delay in finding the item.
    *Reason: The waiter responded to the missing item by searching for it and questioning the customers.*
*   **c) Assurance:** 3. The waiter showed the ability to address the issue but the situation may not have had a confident handling
    *Reason: The waiter handled the situation of the missing item, but there was a lack of confidence.*
*   **d) Empathy:** 1. The waiter's response to the incident showed very little empathy, only focusing on finding the missing item.
    *Reason: The scenario doesn't suggest the waiter understood the customer emotions and the whole interaction was negative*
*   **e) Tangibles:** 4. There is no mention of tangibles, therefore, the score will be neutral.
    *Reason: The description does not provide any information about the waiter's uniform, cleanliness, or the table's condition.*

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**

Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) \* 4 = (1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 4) \* 4 = 48

**5. Total Score**

**5-1. Total Score Calculation**

Total Score = Video Score = 48

**6. Tip Calculation**

**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**

*   Service Level: Based on a score of 48, the service level is classified as Poor.
*   Tipping Percentage: For casual dining in the USA with Poor service, the range is 0-5%.
*   Review Content: The incident described in the Reddit post is negative. The waiter's behavior led to the item being stolen.
*   Final Tip Percentage: Given the negative interaction, a tip of 0% is appropriate.

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability:** 3 - The server acknowledges specific service failures like a delayed drink and missing an item (ranch). However, the acknowledgment of the mistakes indicates the server made errors, but it doesn't specify if orders were inaccurate or if there were billing errors, and doesn't mention any confirmation procedures.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3 - The video doesn't directly show the server's responsiveness. However, the server seems to have been delayed in providing service, suggesting the response speed was not ideal. The server admits to the issues which can be acceptable.
*   **c) Assurance:** 3 - The server acknowledges mistakes and reflects on them, indicating a degree of self-awareness and a desire to improve. But the video doesn't provide information about the server's menu knowledge, confidence, or ability to build customer trust.
*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - The server demonstrates self-reflection on their service, which suggests an attempt to understand the customer's experience, but the video does not show any interaction with the customer, hence does not provide any specific acts of empathy.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - There is no information on tangibles, so we'll assume the appearance of the restaurant is standard, with tidy table settings and uniforms.

1-2. Video Score Calculation
Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4) \* 4 = 64

5.  Total Score
    5-1. Total Score Calculation
    Total Score = 64

6.  Tip Calculation
    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
    *   Service Level: 64 is in the Normal range for casual dining in the USA ([6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%).
    *   Review Content: The server acknowledged the failures in service.
    *   Tipping Percentage: Based on the Reddit post and the server's admission of service issues, a tip at the lower end of the normal range is appropriate. USA casual dining suggests a tip range of 10-15%. Therefore, a 10% tip is appropriate.
    *   Tip Amount: $25.00 \* 0.10 = $2.50
    *   Total Bill: $25.00 + $2.50 = $27.50

*   **c) Assurance:** 1 - The server's lack of menu knowledge and the way he handled the incorrect order demonstrate a lack of confidence and professionalism. He was unable to answer a basic question about the menu.
*   **d) Empathy:** 1 - The server showed no empathy for the customers. He dismissed their concerns and was rude when bringing the check.

### Analysis of the Video and Server Performance

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

*   **a) Reliability: 1**  The servers clearly experienced numerous issues stemming from the customers' behavior. Orders were likely delayed and possibly incorrect due to the complex check splitting and seating arrangements. The long wait times for food to arrive also suggest potential kitchen errors and order inaccuracies.
*   **b) Responsiveness: 3**  The servers were placed in a very difficult situation. While they were likely responsive to the group's needs, they were severely hampered by the group's lack of cooperation. The text mentions servers explaining delays, indicating they were attempting to communicate. However, due to the circumstances the response was average.
*   **c) Assurance: 3** The servers likely tried to explain the situation and the kitchen's processes, but they likely lacked confidence in a situation where the customers were being difficult.
*   **d) Empathy: 3** The servers likely showed basic friendliness, but given the stress and complications caused by the group, it's difficult to imagine them offering personalized service or proactively understanding the customers' emotions.
*   **e) Tangibles: 5** This is difficult to assess from the given information, but the information provided gives no indication of tangibles being dirty or subpar.

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**

Video Score = (1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 5) \* 4 = 60

**5. Total Score**

**5-1. Total Score Calculation**

Total Score = 60

**6. Tip Calculation**

**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**

*   The total score is 60.
*   Based on the provided ranges for USA casual dining, and the fact that this customer was actively difficult, the service level is categorized as Poor.
*   USA Casual dining: Poor \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]%.
*   Given the negative experience, the tip should be at the lower end of the 'Poor' range.

2025-05-11 05:57:38,249 - eval_gemini - INFO - Okay, I will analyze the Reddit post, evaluate the video based on the provided criteria, and calculate the appropriate tip.

### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video
The Reddit post paints a clear picture of a disastrous service experience. The server was clearly overwhelmed due to an unexpectedly large party (30 people instead of the expected 15). This resulted in significant delays, neglected service for other tables, and overall poor customer satisfaction. The video caption summarizes this situation accurately, highlighting the server's struggles with refills, order accuracy, and attending to all customers.

### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability:** 1 - The post indicates order inaccuracies ("godforbid its in the order I sent it") and significant delays. The large party's order was clearly difficult to manage, leading to mistakes or at least the appearance of mistakes in food delivery.
    *   *Justification:* The server struggled to manage the large party and multiple tables, leading to likely errors and a lack of timely delivery of food.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 2 - The server was likely unable to respond quickly due to being overwhelmed by the large party. Other tables were neglected.
    *   *Justification:* The server was understaffed and overwhelmed.
*   **c) Assurance:** 2 - The server likely struggled to provide confident and helpful service given the chaotic situation. It's unlikely they could offer menu suggestions or build customer trust.
    *   *Justification:* Given the extreme pressure, it's unlikely the server could provide professional and confident service.
*   **d) Empathy:** 2 - While the server was likely polite, the situation prevented personalized service or proactive understanding of customer emotions.
    *   *Justification:* The sheer volume of customers would have made it hard to provide personalized or empathetic service.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 3 - There's no direct information about tangibles in the Reddit post, but given the level of stress and the number of tables, it is assumed that the server could maintain an acceptable level of cleanliness.
    *   *Justification:* The post does not contain information on this topic.

*   **6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**
    *   The service level is Poor, based on the video score of 32.
    *   Restaurant Type: Casual dining in USA
    *   Tipping Range: Poor [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%, Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%, Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%
    *   Given the poor service described in the Reddit post and the video, and the customer's clear dissatisfaction, a tip at the lower end of the "Poor" range is warranted.

### Analysis of Reddit Post and Video Caption ###

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability: 2** The server intentionally limited service, such as delaying refills and extra sauces. Orders were technically fulfilled, but the focus was on fulfilling the minimum requirements, not providing a positive experience. Billing accuracy isn't directly mentioned in the video caption, but given the context of the server's actions, it's unlikely there were errors.
*   **b) Responsiveness: 2** While the server maintained a smile and a kind tone, the video caption highlights delays in service. Refills were slow, extra sauces were delayed, and the overall pace of service was intentionally slowed down.
*   **c) Assurance: 3** The server fulfilled the orders as requested and did so with a pleasant demeanor, demonstrating a degree of competence. However, the actions taken demonstrate a lack of confidence in providing a superior level of service.
*   **d) Empathy: 1** The server showed no empathy for this customer. The actions taken suggest that the server was prioritizing the other patrons in the section over this specific customer. There was no attempt to understand or address the customers' needs beyond the bare minimum.
*   **e) Tangibles: 5** The cleanliness of the table and uniform is not mentioned in the context. Given that the user specified a chain brand, the restaurant likely has a ServSafe certification level cleanliness.

### Analysis of the Video and Reviews

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    *   a) Reliability: 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The server correctly recommended a similar beer and acknowledged the customer's request to remove it. The server also correctly stated the timeline for restocking. However, the customer's overall experience ended on a negative note.
        *Reasoning: The server attempted to fulfill the order accurately by suggesting a similar beer.
    *   b) Responsiveness: 4 - Quick and polite responses. The server responded to the customer's complaint about the beer and explained the issue.
        *Reasoning: The server responded quickly and politely to the customer's issues.
    *   c) Assurance: 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The server explained the bar manager's responsibility for the beer inventory but showed no other specific menu knowledge.
        *Reasoning: The server answered the customer's question.
    *   d) Empathy: 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. The server didn't offer any special treatment to the regulars.
        *Reasoning: The server accommodated the customer's request and maintained a basic level of service.
    *   e) Tangibles: 5 - Meets FDA Food Code standards, ServSafe certification level cleanliness. This is assumed based on the absence of any negative comments about cleanliness.

### Video Analysis

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    a) Reliability: 3 - The order was mostly accurate, but the video description does not explicitly detail order accuracy or potential mistakes in the main course.
    b) Responsiveness: 4 - The server was responsive to the customer's request to clear the table and find a new table. They addressed the complaint about the food quickly.
    c) Assurance: 4 - The server demonstrated wine knowledge and professionally addressed the customer's complaint about the food.
    d) Empathy: 3 - The server was polite and offered service recovery.
    e) Tangibles: 4 - The table and uniform are expected to be tidy in a 5-star hotel.

6.  Tip Calculation
    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
        a) Categorize the service level as Poor, Normal, or Good based on the total score and review content.
            The total score of 72 is within the range of Normal.
        b) Determine the tipping percentage within the culturally appropriate range according to the selected country and restaurant type.
            i) Tipping Ranges by Country and Restaurant Type
                USA Casual dining: Poor [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%, Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%, Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%
            ii) Within the same level (Poor/Normal/Good), choose the lower or upper end of the range based on the positivity or negativity of the reviews and video.
            iii) If there are any ethical issues, the tip must be set to 0%.
        Given the negative behavior of the primary customer and the server's actions, the tip will be at the upper end of the Normal range.

          "Final Reason": "Despite good service recovery and wine knowledge, the server's unprofessional behavior of publicly announcing the customer's card declines is taken into consideration.

2025-05-11 05:58:09,336 - eval_gemini - INFO - Okay, I will analyze the video, evaluate the service, and calculate an appropriate tip based on the information provided.

### Video Analysis ###

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

a) Reliability: Score 3
    *   **Reason:** The caption mentions the server refills drinks and pre-busses. These actions are generally reliable. However, there's no mention of order accuracy, so it's difficult to assess reliability in terms of order-taking. The score is set to a moderate level.

b) Responsiveness: Score 4
    *   **Reason:** The caption implies attentive service through pre-bussing and drink refills. While not explicitly stated, these actions suggest a degree of responsiveness. Therefore, the score is set to 4 (Quick and polite responses), as it is a base estimation through the provided caption.

c) Assurance: Score 3
    *   **Reason:** The caption does not provide enough information on the server's ability to explain the menu or handle customer concerns with confidence. Thus, the score is set to 3 (Can explain the menu but lacks confidence) as there is no information.

d) Empathy: Score 3
    *   **Reason:** The caption mentions pre-bussing and drink refills; however, there is no information about personalized service or proactive understanding of customer emotions. Thus, the score is set to 3 (Basic friendliness but lacks personalization).

e) Tangibles: Score 4
    *   **Reason:** The caption does not provide information about the tangible aspects of the service. However, the server is presumably meeting basic cleanliness standards. Thus, the score is set to 4 (Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained) for the estimation.

1-2. Video Score Calculation
    Video Score = (3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 68

5. Total Score
    5-1. Total Score Calculation
    Total Score = Video Score = 68

6. Tip Calculation
    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
    *   Service Level: The total score is 68, which falls within the "Normal" range for casual dining in the USA (6-15%).
    *   Tipping Percentage: Based on the "Normal" service level in the USA for casual dining, the base tip range is 6-15%. The server feels they offer exceptional service.

    Since the server felt they performed exceptional service, I will adjust the tip towards the upper end of the normal range.

    The video shows pre-bussing and drink refills, and the user feels they provide exceptional service.
    Tipping percentage = 15%
    Tip amount = $25.00 * 15% = $3.75
    Total bill = $25.00 + $3.75 = $28.75

### Analysis ###

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria:

*   a) Reliability: 4 - The server delivered the food as agreed in the contract, indicating accurate order fulfillment. The only issue was a missing salad dressing container, which is a minor omission.
*   b) Responsiveness: 5 - The server immediately addressed the complaint about the food by retrieving the food from the kitchen and bringing it back to the room. The server was quickly scrambling to fill drink orders.
*   c) Assurance: 4 - The server was delivering the service as specified in the contract, but the customers kept complaining about the same things.
*   d) Empathy: 3 - While the server quickly took the food back, the server does not show any emotion because the party was late.
*   e) Tangibles: 4 - The server delivered the food in the right place and time. The food was hot, which is a sign that the restaurant cared about the customer.

    a) Categorize the service level as Poor, Normal, or Good based on the total score and review content.
        The total score of 80 falls into the Good range for Casual Dining in the USA.
    b) Determine the tipping percentage within the culturally appropriate range according to the selected country and restaurant type.
        i) Tipping Ranges by Country and Restaurant Type
            1) USA
                 Casual dining: Poor \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%, Normal \[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%, Good \[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%
        ii) Within the same level (Poor/Normal/Good), choose the lower or upper end of the range based on the positivity or negativity of the reviews and video.
        The video shows the customer was not happy and did not want to pay for the services. The party complained about all the details.
        iii) If there are any ethical issues, the tip must be set to 0%.
        There were no ethical issues observed.

    The tip percentage is in the good range, so I choose 16% because of the customer's negativity.
    Tip amount = subtotal * tip percentage.

### Analysis of the Video

The video caption highlights the server's actions. Here's the breakdown of the evaluation criteria:

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

   *   **a) Reliability:** 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The server appears to attempt to meet the customer's needs, which suggests a degree of reliability in fulfilling requests. However, the context also implies potential prioritization issues due to the customer's demands during a busy service.
   *   **b) Responsiveness:** 4 - Quick and polite responses. The server's actions of accommodating requests are prompt and considerate, even when handling a large number of tables, suggesting good responsiveness.
   *   **c) Assurance:** 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The video itself doesn't provide information about the server's menu knowledge. However, the server's behavior indicates politeness and willingness to help but there is no information about the server having confidence in their actions.
   *   **d) Empathy:** 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. The server is seen accommodating a customer's needs, suggesting a baseline level of empathy. However, the customer is viewed as "needy and demanding" and there is no information about offering personalized services.
   *   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. The video description does not give specific details on tangibles, but it can be inferred that the place has been accommodated with necessary needs.

1-2. Video Score Calculation
    Video Score = (3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 68

5.  Total Score
    5-1. Total Score Calculation
        Total Score = Video Score = 68

### Tip Calculation

6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

   *   The total score of 68 falls into the "Good" service level.
   *   The restaurant is a casual dining establishment in the USA.
   *   The "Good" service level for casual dining in the USA has a tipping range of 16-20%.
   *   The review highlights that the server accommodated a difficult customer, despite the customer's demanding behavior and negative tipping. This suggests that the server, although being put in a negative situation, still provided good service. I'll lean towards the upper end of the range.

6-2. Format
    ```json
    {
      "### Video Caption 1 ###": "The server accommodated the customer's specific requests by providing a bowl of hot water immediately upon seating. The server also attempted to prioritize the customer's food order despite the restaurant being busy and having a queue of tickets.

### Analysis of the Video Caption

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

    a) Reliability: 3. The caption mentions perceived delays and issues with drink delivery, which suggests there might be some order discrepancies or delays. However, it doesn't explicitly state mistakes. Therefore, the score is 3. (Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation)
    *Reasoning: The video mentions delays which could mean the orders were not perfectly handled, but it doesn't show any mistakes in order taking. It also doesn't mention confirmation of the order.*

    b) Responsiveness: 2. The caption highlights issues with management's criticism, implying a negative experience with the management's response to the server. This suggests poor responsiveness. The score is 2. (Responds but with significant delays)
    *Reasoning: The caption describes a negative interaction where management was criticizing the server. This implies poor responsiveness from management, although the responsiveness of the server is not directly mentioned.*

    c) Assurance: 1. The server was criticized, and the situation seems to have caused stress. This implies a lack of confidence and ineffective handling of the situation. The score is 1. (Unable to answer menu questions, rude or unfriendly)
    *Reasoning: The criticism from management, and the resulting stress and emotional distress suggest a lack of assurance and confidence in the server's handling of the situation.*

    d) Empathy: 3. The server's focus on treating customers as important suggests some level of empathy. The server was also affected by the events that occurred. Score of 3. (Basic friendliness but lacks personalization)
    *Reasoning: The server's actions are focused on customer satisfaction, so it indicates a level of friendliness.*

    e) Tangibles: 4. The video does not provide any details about the tangibles like cleanliness of the table. This would be considered acceptable, so the score is 3. (Acceptable but lacks attention to detail)
    *Reasoning: Since there is no information about the tangibles, I will assume it to be acceptable.*

1-2. Video Score Calculation
    Video Score = (3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3) * 4 = 48

5.  Total Score
    5-1. Total Score Calculation
        Total Score = 48

6.  Tip Calculation
    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
        a) Categorize the service level as Poor, Normal, or Good based on the total score.
        * The total score is 48.
        * Since the restaurant is casual dining in the USA, the score is higher than the range for Good.
        * **Service Level: Good**
        b) Determine the tipping percentage within the culturally appropriate range.
        * USA, Casual Dining: Poor [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%, Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%, Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%
        * Based on the reviews, there were negative aspects like management issues and delays.
        * The server was still making an effort, which is commendable.
        * The generous tip from the customer is a good sign.
        * Due to the above factors, I will choose a value from the upper end of the Good range: **18%**
        * Tip Amount = $25 * 0.18 = $4.50
        * Total Bill = $25 + $4.50 = $29.50

Here's a breakdown of the video analysis based on the provided criteria and the Reddit post:

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

*   **a) Reliability: 3** The server made a mistake with the initial drink order (lemonade instead of water). However, the error was quickly recognized and addressed, and the server confirmed the drink would not be charged. The server also correctly handled the food order and the issue of the overcooked burger. The server's actions and the eventual outcome demonstrate a level of reliability in correcting mistakes and managing issues effectively.
    *   *Reasoning:* While a mistake occurred, it was promptly addressed and corrected, minimizing its impact. The server's handling of the subsequent issue demonstrates a level of accuracy and reliability.
*   **b) Responsiveness: 5** The server responded immediately to the mistake with the drink order, apologizing and offering a correction. The server also immediately addressed the issue of the overcooked burger, exhibiting excellent responsiveness.
    *   *Reasoning:* The server displayed prompt action and a proactive approach to the customer's complaints.
*   **c) Assurance: 4** The server apologized and offered to fix the problem, demonstrating confident handling of the situation.
    *   *Reasoning:* The server's actions reflect a professional approach to resolving customer issues, building confidence.
*   **d) Empathy: 4** The server shows empathy by apologizing and immediately addressing the problem of overcooked burgers and proactively trying to resolve the situation.
    *   *Reasoning:* The server showed empathy by apologizing and attempting to find a solution.
*   **e) Tangibles: 5** Cleanliness cannot be fully assessed from the description, but there is no mention of cleanliness issues, so it is assumed to be good.
    *   *Reasoning:* This is based on an assumption as cleanliness is not addressed in the provided content.

    *   The country is USA, and the type is casual dining.
    *   Based on the Tip Calculation Guide, the tipping range for "Good" service in a casual dining restaurant in the USA is 16-20%.
    *   The reviews are mixed. The mother tipped 20%, indicating satisfaction with the service. However, the daughter made a complaint which resulted in an internal issue and ultimately the server getting a bad review. Since the server did a good job despite the daughter's complaints, the tip should be high.
    *   The final tip percentage should be 19%.

    a) Reliability: 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The caption mentions food delivery but doesn't specify the order accuracy. The server did not have major mistakes, but there's no mention of confirmation procedures.
    b) Responsiveness: 3 - Average response speed, acceptable performance. The caption doesn't explicitly comment on the speed of service.
    c) Assurance: 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The caption doesn't mention the server's menu knowledge, but the server was able to satisfy a customer request, which indicates basic competence.
    d) Empathy: 4 - Remembers customer preferences, offers personalized services like birthday events. The server recognized the birthday and arranged a special dessert, going above and beyond the basic service.
    e) Tangibles: 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. The caption doesn't provide any information on tangibles. This score assumes that the server follows general restaurant standards.

### Analysis:

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    a) Reliability: 3. The server handled requests accurately, although it wasn't the server's table. The server ensured that the customers' requests were met and the bill was calculated correctly.
        *   **Justification**: The server correctly provided the requested service and accurately handled the bill. The situation did not include order mistakes or billing errors; the server was just covering the table.
    b) Responsiveness: 5. The server was immediately responsive to the customer's requests, which earned him positive feedback from the customers.
        *   **Justification**: The server covered a table and responded to every customer request during a busy rush.
    c) Assurance: 4. The server maintained a professional and friendly demeanor which gave the customer confidence in the server's skills and ability to meet their needs.
        *   **Justification**: The server was able to manage the customer's requests and make them feel comfortable by using a friendly demeanor.
    d) Empathy: 4. The server demonstrated empathy by reading the customer's needs and requests and handling them with consideration.
        *   **Justification**: While there's no specific mention of personalized service or remembering preferences, the server's friendly demeanor and attentiveness to the customers' needs suggest a good level of empathy.
    e) Tangibles: 5. The video did not contain any negative remarks related to tangibles.
        *   **Justification**: No information related to dirty tables, utensils or uniforms was provided.

### Analysis ###

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    a) Reliability: 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The video caption indicates a long wait time due to kitchen delays, but doesn't explicitly mention order inaccuracies. Therefore, the server likely handled the orders accurately but the kitchen's performance affected the overall experience.
        *Reasoning: The video indicates a long wait time due to the kitchen, which is outside the server's direct control. The caption doesn't provide any information about the order's accuracy.*

    b) Responsiveness: 3 - Average response speed, acceptable performance. The caption mentions the server attempted to mitigate the wait time impact, suggesting some level of responsiveness, but the extent and effectiveness are unknown.
        *Reasoning: The video doesn't specifically detail the server's response time or behavior during the wait, but it implies some level of effort to address the issue.*

    c) Assurance: 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The caption doesn't indicate anything about menu questions or confidence. It focuses solely on the impact of the kitchen's slow service.
        *Reasoning: The video provides no information about the waiter's knowledge and confidence, but it focuses on the customer's dissatisfaction with the long wait time.*

    d) Empathy: 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. The server tried to mitigate the impact of the wait, but the caption doesn't offer details about personalized service or empathy shown.
        *Reasoning: The server's efforts to mitigate the impact of the wait suggest some degree of empathy but with no mention of personalized care or understanding of the customer's feelings.*

    e) Tangibles: 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. The video does not give any specific information, but it's a causal dining restaurant, so the restaurant's and server's tidiness is taken for granted.
        *Reasoning: Since no evidence suggests otherwise, assume the restaurant and server's environment is tidy and maintained.*

6.  Tip Calculation
    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
        a) Categorize the service level as Poor, Normal, or Good based on the total score and review content.
            The total score is 64.
            For USA casual dining, the score falls into the range of Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%.
        b) Determine the tipping percentage within the culturally appropriate range according to the selected country and restaurant type.
            Since the customer was very dissatisfied, and left no tip at all, the tipping amount should be set to a low value.
            The customer's dissatisfaction was not the server's fault, but the kitchen's fault.
            For USA casual dining, Normal tipping range is 6-15%. Therefore, the tip amount should be 6%.

### Analysis of the provided Reddit Post and Video Caption ###

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

a) Reliability: 5. The server accurately provided exactly what the customers wanted, even though it was an unusual request. The orders were handled accurately, and the server went above and beyond by anticipating the customers' needs and proactively refilling drinks.

b) Responsiveness: 5. The server was extremely responsive and proactive. They immediately addressed the customers' needs by anticipating their drink requests. They also promptly provided the tickets when requested.

c) Assurance: 4. The server confidently handled the situation. They also used a bit of humor and motivational tactics to create a more memorable experience.

d) Empathy: 4. The server showed genuine interest in the customers' experience, going beyond basic service by personalizing the interaction and showing a willingness to go the extra mile. The server made the service memorable and amusing to customers.

e) Tangibles: 5. While the post doesn't mention the tangibles such as cleanliness, the focus is on the service and the server's proactive approach.

1-2. Video Score Calculation
Video Score = (5 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5) * 4 = 92

5. Total Score
5-1. Total Score Calculation
Total Score = 92

6. Tip Calculation
6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

The service level is determined to be Good based on the total score of 92.
Since the country is USA and the restaurant type is Casual dining, the tipping range is Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%, and Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%.
Considering the excellent service described in the Reddit post and the video caption, the tip should be at the upper end of the "Good" range.

The server provided exceptional service. They went above and beyond to personalize the experience, exceeding expectations.

Therefore, the tipping percentage will be 20%.

Tip = $25.00 * 0.20 = $5.00
Total Bill = $25.00 + $5.00 = $30.00

### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video Caption

The Reddit post describes a positive customer experience. The server was attentive, communicated clearly about the automatic gratuity, and engaged with the family, making them feel comfortable and entertained. The grandmother's feedback ("excellent service" and "corny jokes") strongly indicates high customer satisfaction. The fact that the family left an additional $200 tip, even after the automatic gratuity, is a clear indication of exceptional service.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

Since we already have a Video Caption, the evaluation criteria will be based on the provided caption.

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   a) Reliability: **5** - The caption indicates no issues with order accuracy or billing. The automatic gratuity was clearly communicated.
    *   *Justification*: The post highlights good communication regarding the bill, so a high score is justified.
*   b) Responsiveness: **5** - The server was attentive and responsive, engaging with the customers.
    *   *Justification*: The server's engagement and jokes suggest a high level of responsiveness and attentiveness.
*   c) Assurance: **5** - The server's ability to make "corny jokes" suggests confident and friendly interaction.
    *   *Justification*: The willingness to engage in jokes suggests the server built rapport and confidence.
*   d) Empathy: **5** - The server's actions, including the jokes, show a genuine effort to connect with and provide a positive experience for the family.
    *   *Justification*: The server went above and beyond.
*   e) Tangibles: **4** - While there's no information in the prompt about tangibles, it's safe to assume cleanliness standards were met.
    *   *Justification*: No negative comments from the customer about tangibles are available.

1-2. Video Score Calculation

Video Score = (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4) \* 4 = 96

*   Service Level: Good (Because the video score is high).
*   Tipping Percentage: The country is USA, and the restaurant type is Casual Dining.
    *   Casual Dining: Poor \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%, Normal \[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%, Good \[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%
    *   Given the excellent service, the tip percentage should be at the high end of the "Good" range.
*   Based on the excellent service demonstrated in the video, I'll assign the upper limit of the "Good" range, which is 20%.

### Video Analysis

1.  **Video Evaluation Criteria**

    a)  **Reliability:** 3. The server made a mistake by initially not remembering the check request. However, the order itself (assuming only drinks were ordered) was likely accurate. The delay in bringing the check and the later confrontation detract from this score.
    *Justification:* While the server eventually provided the check, the initial miscommunication and subsequent delay indicate a lack of attentiveness. The server's confrontation with the customer also reveals a lack of professionalism that impacts the reliability score.
    b)  **Responsiveness:** 2. The server was slow to respond to the check request, leading to the customer's frustration.
    *Justification:* The delay in bringing the check shows a lack of responsiveness. The server's response to the check request wasn't immediate, and the later confrontation further highlights poor responsiveness.
    c)  **Assurance:** 1. The server's demeanor and actions, including disputing the check request and ultimately confronting the customer, are far from professional. They did not inspire customer confidence.
    *Justification:* The server's actions throughout the interaction did not provide assurance. Arguing with the customer and the later confrontation completely break any pretense of a professional demeanor.
    d)  **Empathy:** 1. The server showed no empathy during the interaction, especially regarding the customer’s concerns, and displayed anger and hostility during the confrontation.
    *Justification:* The server showed no empathy at all. The response was rude and confrontational, completely ignoring the customer's perspective.
    e)  **Tangibles:** 4. The video doesn't explicitly mention the cleanliness of the table, but the review is unrelated to tangibles.
    *Justification:* Since the video doesn't contain information about the cleanliness, I can only assume it is normal.

2.  **Video Score Calculation**

    Video Score = (3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4) * 4 = 44

### Total Score

5-1. Total Score Calculation
   Total Score = 44

### Tip Calculation

6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

*   Service Level: Poor. The server's behavior, as described in the video and the user review, indicates very poor service.
*   Tipping Percentage: USA, Casual dining: Poor \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%. Given the extremely negative interaction, and the user’s poor experience. Zero tip is the only ethical choice.
*   Ethical Considerations: The server's actions (confrontation, use of profanity, and the note written on the receipt) justify a 0% tip.

### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability:** 1 - The server's actions directly caused a significant negative outcome for the customers (being blocked in, missing their show). This demonstrates a clear failure in reliability.
    *   *Reason:* The server intentionally created a problem for the customers.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 1 - The server was aware of the customers' time constraint ("in a hurry") but still intentionally prolonged their exit.
    *   *Reason:* The server knowingly caused a problem for the customers, despite their stated need to leave quickly.
*   **c) Assurance:** 1 - The server's actions were the opposite of assuring. They created a stressful and negative situation, showing no concern for the customers' experience.
    *   *Reason:* The server acted against the customer's interests, making them miss their show.
*   **d) Empathy:** 1 - The server showed zero empathy. Their actions were directly designed to inconvenience the customers, with no regard for their situation or feelings.
    *   *Reason:* The server intentionally made the customers' situation worse.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 5 - The text provided focuses on service interactions and doesn't mention anything about the restaurant's cleanliness.
    *   *Reason:* The text doesn't describe the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or uniform.

### 1-2. Video Score Calculation

### 5. Total Score

5-1. Total Score Calculation

Total Score = Video Score = 36

### 6. Tip Calculation

6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

*   Service Level: The total score is 36, which indicates Very Poor service.
*   Tipping Percentage:
    *   Country: USA
    *   Restaurant Type: Casual Dining
    *   Poor \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]% The text describes the waiter as creating an extremely negative situation.
    *   Since the service was intentionally bad, the tip should be at the lowest possible end of the "Poor" category.

*   Review Content: The Reddit post describes an intentional negative act on the part of the server.

    *   Ethical Issues: The server's actions caused the customers to miss their show and suffer significant inconvenience.
    *   Tip: 0%

### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video Caption
The Reddit post describes a challenging dining experience. The server handled multiple customer requests, custom orders, and the addition of extra guests. The customers, particularly the omelet-ordering individual, were described as difficult and picky. Their constant requests and changes put a strain on the server. The video caption corroborates these events, stating that the server responded to numerous requests and handled the custom order. The customer's perception, as stated in the Reddit post, was that they felt they had to ask for everything.

### Video Evaluation Criteria and Scoring

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

    a) Reliability: 3
    *   **Justification:** The server took multiple orders and handled a custom omelet, but there were also multiple requests for items and modifications to the order. While the server managed, the constant changes suggest the potential for errors or omissions in a busy environment. Though the caption does not indicate errors, the sheer number of requests creates a higher possibility for mistakes compared to a standard order.

    b) Responsiveness: 4
    *   **Justification:** The server responded to the customer's requests in a timely manner throughout the meal, but the customer felt they needed to request everything. The video caption indicates the server did address requests but did not always anticipate needs proactively.

    c) Assurance: 3
    *   **Justification:** The server clarified ingredients and handled the complex omelet order, but the customer perceived the need to continually ask for items. While the server was likely polite and professional, the high number of requests might have made the customers feel less assured, as if the basics were not being covered. The need to ask for many things and the customers' perceptions of this, implies a moderate level of confidence and explanation, but did not "earn customer trust".

    d) Empathy: 3
    *   **Justification:** The server likely maintained a baseline level of friendliness and politeness. However, the post and caption do not reveal an attempt to personalize the service or proactively address the customer's feelings or predict their needs. The server did accommodate a difficult group, and may have tried to show empathy in their responses.

    e) Tangibles: 4
    *   **Justification:** There is no information provided about the restaurant's environment in either the video or the reddit post. Therefore, I'll assume that the server provided good table service and that the uniform and table setting were tidy and well maintained.

1-2. Video Score Calculation
    Video Score = (3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 68

5.  Total Score
    5-1. Total Score Calculation
        Total Score = 68

6.  Tip Calculation
    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
        a) The service level is categorized as Normal.
        b) Since the service level is Normal and the restaurant type is Casual Dining in the USA, the tipping range is [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%.
            *   The Reddit post and video show the customer being picky and difficult.
            *   The customers are the reason for the server needing to do so much.
            *   The customers left a small tip, which is a key indicator of perceived service quality.
            *   The tip will fall in the lower side of the normal service range.
        c) Since the customer's review on the service provided in the video indicates that the service was normal, and the customer also left a very small tip, then, 8% is the perfect tipping percentage.

2025-05-11 05:59:24,575 - eval_gemini - INFO - Here's an analysis and tip calculation based on the provided information:

### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability:** Score 3.
    *   **Reason:** The video description doesn't mention any issues with order accuracy or mistakes. It focuses on the server's behavior, not the practical aspects of the service. The lack of information means we cannot give it a higher score. The service was not mentioned in the video.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** Score 3.
    *   **Reason:** The video describes interactions. While the server approached the customer, the description does not provide information on response speed or proactiveness. There is not enough information to increase the score.
*   **c) Assurance:** Score 2.
    *   **Reason:** The video focuses on the server's behavior. While the video shows interactions, the description doesn't cover whether the server could answer menu questions or handle the situation with confidence.
*   **d) Empathy:** Score 1.
    *   **Reason:** Based on the customer's experience, the server's actions, while possibly intended to be friendly, were interpreted as rude and insulting. The server's behavior did not indicate an understanding of the customer's emotional state.
*   **e) Tangibles:** Score 3.
    *   **Reason:** The video doesn't provide information about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. However, assuming a basic level of service.

### 1-2. Video Score Calculation

*   Video Score = (3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3) * 4 = 48

### 5. Total Score

*   5-1. Total Score Calculation
    Total Score = 48

### 6. Tip Calculation

*   6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
    *   The service level is categorized as Poor due to the customer's negative experience.
    *   In the USA, casual dining, the Poor range is 0-5%. The customer's reaction (giving a 0% tip) confirms a negative experience. There is no information from google reviews.
    *   The tip is 0% because of the customer's negative perception of the service.
*   6-2. Format

She also engaged in actions like pushing her chest together and playing with her hair during these interactions. The text does not provide details on her handling of service aspects like order accuracy, timing, or standard attentiveness to needs.",

###Analysis###

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

*   **a) Reliability:** 5 - The server correctly handled the initial wine order and followed through with the pouring ritual. They also correctly identified the problem and quickly solved the situation with appropriate actions, refusing to serve more alcohol.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - The server was immediately responsive in handling the wine order and checking if the table was ready to order. The server also listened to the customers and reacted very promptly.
*   **c) Assurance:** 5 - The server maintained professionalism and confidence when dealing with a difficult situation, apologizing for the inconvenience and making a firm decision in the best interest of the customers.
*   **d) Empathy:** 5 - The server demonstrated a clear understanding of the situation and the need to protect the other patrons by refusing to serve more alcohol to the visibly intoxicated man.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 5 - The scenario focused on service rather than tangibles, but based on the description of a fine dining setting, it's reasonable to assume that the environment was clean and well-maintained.

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**

*   Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) \* 4
*   Video Score = (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5) \* 4 = 100

**5. Total Score**

*   5-1. Total Score Calculation
    *   Total Score = Video Score
    *   Total Score = 100

**6. Tip Calculation**

*   6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
    *   The service level is categorized as Good, as the video score is 100.
    *   The restaurant is fine dining in the USA. Therefore, the tipping range is Good [20]%.
    *   The server handled a difficult and potentially dangerous situation professionally and with consideration for the customers' safety.
*   6-2. Format
    *   Based on the information, the final tip percentage should be 20%.

### Analysis of the Provided Information:

**1. Video Caption Analysis:**

*   **Reliability:** 3 - The server initially made a billing error, but promptly corrected it. This indicates an issue with order accuracy but was addressed quickly.
    *   *Justification:* The server forgot to charge for a round of drinks and had to correct it. This is a minor omission, not a major mistake, but a mistake nonetheless.
*   **Responsiveness:** 5 - The server responded to the customer's complaint immediately and addressed the issue.
    *   *Justification:* The server responded to the customer's complaint about the extra charge without delay.
*   **Assurance:** 4 - The server handled the situation professionally and confidently, explaining the corrections made to the bill.
    *   *Justification:* The server addressed the situation with a "sweet" demeanor and clearly communicated the adjustments.
*   **Empathy:** 3 - The server's actions suggest a degree of customer service, though the recounting in the Reddit post implies a hint of playful satisfaction with the outcome.
    *   *Justification:* The server corrected the bill and was able to handle the situation professionally.
*   **Tangibles:** 4 - The cleanliness of the table is not mentioned in the description, but the situation described suggests a functional environment that does not affect the tip amount.
    *   *Justification:* There is no information to indicate poor tangible conditions

**2. Video Score Calculation:**
*   Video Score = (3 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 76

**3. Total Score:**
*   Total Score = Video Score = 76

**4. Tip Calculation:**

*   **Service Level:** Based on a video score of 76 and the review content (initial billing error followed by a correction), the service level is considered Normal.
*   **Tipping Range:**
    *   Country: USA, Type: Casual Dining = Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%
*   **Tip Percentage:** The service was acceptable, with a minor error corrected. Considering the situation was rectified, and the server did not have an ethical issue, the tip amount should be in the middle of the range. Therefore, the tip should be set to 10%.
*   **Tip Amount:** $25.00 * 0.10 = $2.50
*   **Total Bill:** $25.00 + $2.50 = $27.50

###Output indicator###

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    a) Reliability: 3. The server accurately fulfilled orders for soup, salad, and cheese, though the sheer volume of refills could be seen as a strain on efficiency. There were no major mistakes or billing errors.
    b) Responsiveness: 3. The server was responsive to customer needs, fulfilling requests for refills and cheese grating promptly, but the frequent trips to the kitchen might have resulted in some delays.
    c) Assurance: 3. The server was able to explain the lunch special and the process of grating cheese, demonstrating sufficient knowledge of the menu and service procedures, but there's no indication of exceptional confidence or upselling.
    d) Empathy: 3. The server likely showed basic friendliness, offering refills and cheese with a smile, but the description lacks any indication of personalized service or going above and beyond to create a memorable experience.
    e) Tangibles: 3. The video doesn't offer details, however the server's personal hygiene and the table presentation appeared acceptable, but with no specific comments on cleanliness.

### Analysis of the Video and Reviews

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability:** 5 - The server accurately delivered a complex drink order and handled a modified meal, including confirming an allergy. This demonstrates 100% accuracy and attention to detail.
    *   **Justification:** The video description explicitly mentions the server's accuracy in fulfilling specific and complex customer requests (stirred scotch, modified meal with allergy considerations and extra ingredients). This surpasses the standard for reliability, warranting a top score.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - The server maintained a professional demeanor while handling customer complaints and offered solutions like involving a manager or compensating the meal.
    *   **Justification:** The description highlights proactive service recovery. Offering to involve a manager or comp a meal demonstrates a high level of responsiveness to customer needs and complaints.
*   **c) Assurance:** 4 - The server maintained a professional demeanor, offering solutions and handling complaints.
    *   **Justification:** While the video doesn't explicitly discuss the server's knowledge of the menu, the actions taken (handling complaints, offering solutions) suggest competence and confidence in the service.
*   **d) Empathy:** 4 - The server's actions in response to complaints suggest an understanding of customer dissatisfaction.
    *   **Justification:** The server's willingness to offer solutions, potentially comping the meal, indicates an effort to understand and address the customer's negative experience, showing empathy.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - The video doesn't provide information about tangibles, but given that there are no negative comments, this aspect is considered to be clean and tidy.
    *   **Justification:** The provided information is insufficient to analyze this field. However, there are no negative comments, which leads to the conclusion of average tangibles.

    *   Service Level: Good (88 falls within the Good range for USA casual dining, which is 16-20%).
    *   Tipping Percentage: Based on the video analysis and the Reddit post, the server provided excellent service, handling complex orders and complaints professionally. The Reddit post implies a difficult customer base, suggesting the server is working hard and deserves a good tip. Therefore, I will select a generous tip at the higher end of the "Good" range.
    *   Tip Calculation Guide: USA, Casual dining, Good service = 19%

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

    a) Reliability: 2
        The server made a mistake by clearing the table while the customers were away. This indicates a lack of attention to detail and potentially incorrect order handling, resulting in a lower score.

    b) Responsiveness: 3
        The video doesn't show the server's response, but the context implies the server was likely unaware of the customers' needs at the time of the mistake. No immediate response occurred, but the server was likely busy with other tasks due to being understaffed.

    c) Assurance: 3
        While the video doesn't provide information about the server's menu knowledge or confidence, the incident suggests a lack of attention to customer needs and possibly a lack of experience. However, the server could be new.

    d) Empathy: 2
        The video shows the server's action, which resulted in a negative customer experience. The server did not appear to consider the customer's feelings or anticipate their needs.

    e) Tangibles: 4
        The video doesn't offer details on cleanliness. However, the server was cleaning the table. We can assume the table settings were tidy, and cleanliness was maintained.

1-2. Video Score Calculation
    Video Score = (2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4) * 4 = 56

5.  Total Score
    5-1. Total Score Calculation
        Total Score = Video Score = 56

6.  Tip Calculation

    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
        The total score of 56 is interpreted as Normal service since 56 falls in the range [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The user reviews mention the customer was upset; therefore, we will use the lower end of the "Normal" range, which is 10%.

        Tipping Ranges by Country and Restaurant Type
           1) USA
                Casual dining: Poor [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%, Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%, Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%

The video depicts a server interacting with a table in a pizza restaurant. The server is flagged down by the new table and promptly takes their order. The server patiently answers the customer's questions, clarifying menu options, and then repeats the order back to the customers.

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    a) Reliability: 3 - The server made a mistake in the order, but it was quickly corrected.
        *Reason: The server correctly took and submitted the order. However, the father changed the order, which the server then corrected. There was some initial confusion with the crust type, but it was quickly rectified.*
    b) Responsiveness: 5 - The server immediately responded to the customer's request.
        *Reason: The server immediately responded to the customer flagging them down, showing a high level of attentiveness.*
    c) Assurance: 4 - The server was confident in their handling of the order, even when answering questions, and provided professional explanations.
        *Reason: The server explained the menu options and offered clarification. The server remained polite and professional despite customer confusion.*
    d) Empathy: 3 - The server displayed friendliness but did not go above and beyond in personalization.
        *Reason: The server maintained a friendly and professional demeanor. The server remained patient even though the customers had difficult questions.*
    e) Tangibles: 5 - The environment is not addressed in the description, so it is assumed to be clean.
        *Reason: The video is about an order, and tangibles are not mentioned.*

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

a) Reliability: 1
    *   **Reasoning:** The server admits to a significant service failure (20-minute wait for the check) and being overwhelmed, indicating potential for order mistakes or billing errors.

b) Responsiveness: 2
    *   **Reasoning:** While the server is apologetic in the Reddit post, the post itself is reactive. The post doesn't reflect immediate responsiveness during the meal, only after the fact.

c) Assurance: 2
    *   **Reasoning:** The server's post expresses remorse but doesn't demonstrate professional menu knowledge or confidence in handling customer concerns during the actual service.

d) Empathy: 3
    *   **Reasoning:** The server demonstrates empathy by acknowledging the customer's negative experience and expressing sadness over the lack of a tip. They attempt to explain the situation and show understanding of the customer's frustration.

e) Tangibles: 3
    *   **Reasoning:** The text doesn't provide information about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or uniform. However, it does not mention any problem either, so it's a neutral state.

*   Service Level: Based on the Total Score of 44, the service level is "Poor."
*   Tipping Range: In the USA, for casual dining, the range for "Poor" service is 0-5%.
*   Review Content: The Reddit post describes a very negative experience. The server admits failure and the customer left no tip.

Final Tip: The tip percentage should be at the lowest end, 0% because the customer was not satisfied.

### Analysis of the Video

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability:** 4. The server correctly handled the order, delivered the food, and checked on the table multiple times. They followed company policy regarding the bill, but there was a conflict regarding the food. The food was eaten, and the customer's complaint came too late.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 4. The server was responsive by checking on the table three times and immediately responding when the customer requested to speak with them.
*   **c) Assurance:** 4. The server explained the company policy professionally and confidently. The server recommended a solution for their next visit.
*   **d) Empathy:** 3. The server provided an apology, but the interaction was not personalized, and it's not evident the server went above and beyond to improve the experience.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 5. (This is based on the information provided, which does not contain any negative details.)

2025-05-11 06:00:17,106 - eval_gemini - INFO - Okay, I'm ready to analyze the situation and calculate the appropriate tip. Here's my breakdown based on the provided information:

**1. Video Caption Analysis**

The video caption describes the server's tasks and the challenging environment. The key issues are:

*   **Complexities:** Handling large, fluctuating group sizes, fast drink consumption, and difficult check splitting.
*   **Time constraints:** Dealing with late arrivals and the impending close of the buffet.
*   **Cleanup:** Extensive cleanup required.

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

Let's score the video based on the criteria:

*   **a) Reliability:** 3 - The caption doesn't suggest many order mistakes, but it highlights the challenges of managing a busy buffet and potential for errors with large groups and complex check splitting. However, there is no direct evidence of consistent mistakes.
    *Reasoning:* The caption focuses on systemic challenges rather than specific errors.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3 - The caption doesn't explicitly mention responsiveness, but the context implies the server is likely dealing with multiple demands at once, possibly leading to average response times.
    *Reasoning:* The sheer volume of tasks suggests a potentially average response time.
*   **c) Assurance:** 3 - The caption doesn't give specifics on how the server handles menu questions. However, because the context is buffet style, this is not a primary concern.
    *Reasoning:* Not applicable.
*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - The caption suggests the server is probably trying to provide service, though not particularly personalized.
    *Reasoning:* There are no indications of proactive understanding or exceptional service.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - The caption implies an environment that is clean but may be affected by the large volume of traffic at the buffet.
    *Reasoning:* The server is mentioned as needing to clean up, thus implying the area is mostly clean.

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**

Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4) \* 4 = 64

**5. Total Score**

**5-1. Total Score Calculation**

Total Score = Video Score = 64

**6. Tip Calculation**

**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**

*   **Service Level:** Based on the video score of 64, the service level is considered "Normal".

*   **Tipping Percentage:**
    *   Country: USA
    *   Restaurant Type: Casual dining
    *   Normal range: \[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%
*   **Review Context:** The Reddit post expresses frustration with the customers.
*   **Final Tip Percentage:** With the issues described in the Reddit post, I will choose a tip percentage that is on the lower side. Thus, it will be at 7%

*   **Tip Amount Calculation:**

    Subtotal: $25.00
    Tip Percentage: 7%
    Tip Amount = $25.00 \* 0.07 = $1.75
    Total Bill = $25.00 + $1.75 = $26.75

**6-2. Format**

```json
{
  "### Video Caption i(th) ###": "The server's tasks included seating guests, keeping drinks filled, pre-bussing plates, taking and delivering drink orders, managing late arrivals near closing, handling complex separate checks, and performing extensive cleanup. The environment presented challenges such as rapidly changing large group sizes, fast drink consumption, unclear headcount, and difficult check splitting.",
  "Final Reason": "Based on the Normal service level, customer frustration described in the Reddit post, and using USA casual dining tipping guidelines, the final tip percentage is set at 7%.",
  "final_tip_percentage": 7,
  "final_tip_amount": 1.75,

### Analysis

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability:** 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation.
    *   **Justification:** The video description doesn't mention any order mistakes, so the reliability should be high. However, the narrative focuses on check splitting and customer interactions, it does not have any evidence of orders and confirmations.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3 - Average response speed, acceptable performance.
    *   **Justification:** The server was responsive to the initial check-splitting request, but the subsequent actions and the Karen's complaint indicate some delay in returning the cards. This situation is not that the server is slow; rather, there are issues such as high demand, and a process to close out the check. However, due to the high demand, the server handled the situation with the expectation of an acceptable performance.
*   **c) Assurance:** 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence.
    *   **Justification:** The server explained the check-splitting situation, but the defensive response to the complaint about card-holding time suggests a lack of confidence in handling the situation. The server was confident, yet his actions could be considered as unconfident.
*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization.
    *   **Justification:** The server offered to split the check, but the personalized note "lt;3 Princess Pacexmaker" seems sarcastic and counterproductive. It indicates an attempt at some form of personalization, but it was not a friendly one.
*   **e) Tangibles:** Not applicable to the video content. The content is all about the interaction with the server, hence the tangibles cannot be evaluated.

1-2. Video Score Calculation
    Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3)*4 = 60

2.  User Reviews

    *   The user's review describes a confrontational interaction with a customer, including a negative comment on the server's demeanor, a very low tip, and the theft of the pen.

3.  Google Reviews

    *   Not Applicable since there is no Google review.

4.  Star Rating

    *   Not applicable since there is no star rating.

5.  Total Score

    5-1. Total Score Calculation
    Total Score = Video Score = 60

6.  Tip Calculation

    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
        *   Based on the video analysis and user review, the service level is considered as Poor, because of the low customer satisfaction and the overall interaction.
        *   Country: USA, Type: Casual dining, Poor [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%.
        *   Considering the negative reviews and the customer's dissatisfaction and the ethical issue of the user reviewing it. Since there are bad customer interactions and the server's actions are not professional, resulting in a very low tip, the tip should be set to 0%.

### Video Caption Analysis
The video caption describes a positive experience with the waitstaff being attentive and the restaurant being well-staffed. However, there was a significant issue with the food (plastic in the mashed potatoes), which the manager addressed by comping the meal. The waitress was "super duper girl," according to the user. Despite the food issue, the waitress was well-received and the customer had a positive experience with the staff.

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

*   **a) Reliability:**
    *   **Score: 3**
    *   **Reason:** While the waitress and staff were attentive, there was a clear issue with the food quality (plastic in mashed potatoes), indicating a lapse in reliability. The order was not completely accurate since the mashed potatoes contained foreign objects, but the manager quickly attempted to rectify the situation by comping the meal.
*   **b) Responsiveness:**
    *   **Score: 4**
    *   **Reason:** The waitress and the manager were responsive to the customer's complaint about the plastic. The waitress quickly communicated the manager's solution.
*   **c) Assurance:**
    *   **Score: 4**
    *   **Reason:** The waitress and the manager, while dealing with a significant issue in the food, displayed a professional response in their communication. They handled the situation with assurance, by comping the meal.
*   **d) Empathy:**
    *   **Score: 4**
    *   **Reason:** The waitress showed empathy by recognizing the customer's grossed out reaction and the manager by offering a solution. The waitress was later applauded on Yelp which showed a more personal relationship.
*   **e) Tangibles:**
    *   **Score: 3**
    *   **Reason:** The presence of plastic in the food indicates a failure in maintaining cleanliness at the FDA Food Code standards, which would affect the score. However, overall the cleanliness and other tangibles can be assumed as acceptable because the customer returned, ate most of the food, and complimented the waitress.

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**
Video Score = (3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3) \* 4 = 72
Since the maximum score is 100, the correct formula will be: (3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3) \* 4 = 72 / 5 = 14.4. Since the result should be an integer, the result will be 14.

**5. Total Score**
**5-1. Total Score Calculation**
Total Score = Video Score = 14

**6. Tip Calculation**
**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**
*   **Service Level:** Normal (14 falls within the Normal range for USA Casual dining: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%)
*   **Tipping Percentage:** The waitress was "awesome" according to the review, but there was a major issue with the food. Since the customer's experience was overall positive despite the error, and the waitress was applauded, I'll use the upper end of the "Normal" range.
    *   Tipping Percentage = 15%

The Reddit post and the provided video caption detail a challenging situation for a solo server. The server was overwhelmed by a sudden influx of customers, leading to multiple errors and delays. A particularly unpleasant customer, a "Karen," compounded the stress with harsh criticism and a minimal tip.

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

*   **a) Reliability:** 1 - The server made multiple mistakes, including incorrect food delivery and a billing error.
    *   **Justification:** The video caption explicitly mentions incorrect food delivery and a payment processing error.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 2 - The server was delayed due to the overwhelming workload and was unable to refill drinks.
    *   **Justification:** The post describes unfilled drinks and delays due to the server being the only one on duty.
*   **c) Assurance:** 3 - The server attempted to explain the situation and apologized, but the explanation was not accepted by the customer.
    *   **Justification:** The server attempted to explain the difficult circumstances, but the customer was dismissive.
*   **d) Empathy:** 1 - The server was clearly under stress and received no empathy from a customer.
    *   **Justification:** The server was criticized and belittled, and the customer showed no understanding of the challenging circumstances.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - The reddit post doesn't mention the condition of the table or the server's appearance, so we can only assume that the basic level of tidiness was there.
    *   **Justification:** The post did not include any details about the table or the server's appearance.

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**

Video Score = (1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 4) \* 4 = 44

*   Country: USA, Type: Casual dining
*   Tipping Range: Poor [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%
*   Considering the extremely negative customer experience and the issues presented, the tip should be at the lower end of the "Poor" range.

### Analysis of the Reddit Post, Video Caption, and User Input

1.  **Video Caption Analysis:**

    *   **a) Reliability:** 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The caption states the server handled the drink orders correctly and there were no major problems with the table. The caption doesn't specifically mention if the server confirmed the order.
        *   *Reasoning*: The video caption focuses on the server's interaction with the table and implies accurate handling of the order and drink orders and food.
    *   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - Immediate response, friendly tone and facial expressions, proactive problem-solving. The server immediately took over the table to solve the initial mistake.
        *   *Reasoning*: The server proactively solved the issue of the initial seating error and immediately took over the service.
    *   **c) Assurance:** 4 - Professional explanations, confident handling. The server was sarcastic throughout the service and didn't have major problems throughout the night.
        *   *Reasoning*: The server introduced themself, acknowledged the mistake, and continued service.
    *   **d) Empathy:** 4 - Remembers customer preferences, offers personalized services like birthday events. The server was able to take over the table and get on with the service with sarcasm.
        *   *Reasoning*: Although the server used sarcasm, they were able to prevent further problems.
    *   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. The video caption did not provide information about the tangibles, so assuming the cleanliness of a casual dining restaurant.
        *   *Reasoning*: The video caption did not give any information regarding tangibles.

2.  **Video Score Calculation:**
    Video Score = (3 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4) \* 4 = 80

3.  **Total Score:**
    Total Score = 80

4.  **Tip Calculation:**

    *   Service Level: Good (Since 80 is within the Good range of 16-20%)
    *   Tipping Percentage: USA Casual dining: Good \[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%. Based on the user review and the good experience described in the video caption, the tip should be at the higher end of the range.
    *   Final Tip Percentage: 20%
    *   Final Tip Amount: 25.00 \* 0.20 = $5.00
    *   Final Total Bill: 25.00 + 5.00 = $30.00

### Video Analysis

*   **Video Caption Analysis:** The video analysis highlights efficient service under pressure, adaptation to challenging conditions, and overall positive customer experience.

    *   **a) Reliability:** 4 - The servers were able to handle the orders quickly even though there were a lot of them. They were able to provide a good service and handled the situation even if there were complications with the broken HVAC system.
        *   *Justification:* The description indicates that orders were managed quickly and efficiently, despite the unexpected influx of customers. There is no mention of order mistakes.
    *   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - The staff immediately responded to the sudden influx of customers and adapted to the situation and handled all the needs of the customers.
        *   *Justification:* The text states that the staff immediately responded to the situation to accommodate the crowd and proactively created a solution to serve the customers.
    *   **c) Assurance:** 4 - The staff was able to handle the situation and did so with the customers in mind. They made sure to announce the solution that was able to accommodate the customers and it was a good experience.
        *   *Justification:* The manager made a grand announcement, expecting the guests to turn away but they still took the new seating and loved it.
    *   **d) Empathy:** 4 - The staff did not directly show empathy but the manager showed care for their customer by making the announcement about the patio. The manager was also very concerned with how the situation affected the golf crowd.
        *   *Justification:* The staff showed care for their customers by providing them the option to move to the patio to accommodate them.
    *   **e) Tangibles:** 3 - The condition of the restaurant was not ideal due to the fact that the HVAC was broken and it was hot. The floors were also green but the staff made the best of the situation.
        *   *Justification:* The restaurant's condition was less than ideal with the broken HVAC system and floor conditions, but the staff worked around the conditions.

*   **Video Score Calculation:** Video Score = (4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 3) \* 4 = 80

### Total Score

*   **5-1. Total Score Calculation:** Total Score = Video Score = 80

### Tip Calculation

*   **6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**

    *   The service level is considered *Good* because the total score is high.
    *   Based on the country (USA) and restaurant type (Casual Dining), the tip range is 15-20%.
    *   The video and reviews are very positive.
    *   The tip percentage will be on the higher end of the range (20%).

2025-05-11 06:01:03,813 - eval_gemini - INFO - Okay, I will analyze the video caption, evaluate the waiter's performance, and calculate the tip based on the provided information.

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

*   **a) Reliability:** 3. The video caption indicates service delays (20 minutes for food, 5 minutes for refills). This suggests some order fulfillment issues due to the overwhelming workload but doesn't explicitly mention order mistakes. Therefore, a score of 3 seems appropriate.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3. While the server was "working intensely," the delays described in the caption (20 minutes for food, 5 minutes for refills) indicate a slower response time. This is likely due to the high table ratio and challenging environment, but the responsiveness is affected. The score of 3 indicates average response speed in the context of the extreme circumstances.
*   **c) Assurance:** 3. The caption mentions the server was attempting to manage the challenging situation. This suggests the server acknowledged the issues. However, there's no indication of confident menu explanations or premium suggestions. A score of 3 is assigned as they are likely capable of explaining but lack confidence.
*   **d) Empathy:** 3. The server is described as attempting to manage a challenging situation, implying they understand the difficulties. However, there is no mention of personalized services or proactively understanding customer emotions. Therefore, the server is likely capable but it lacks personalization.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 4. The provided caption does not explicitly mention any tangibles such as the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or uniform. Although a low staff level is mentioned, there is nothing that could negatively impact the service so a score of 4 is given.

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**

Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 64

**5. Total Score**

**5-1. Total Score Calculation**

Total Score = Video Score = 64

**6. Tip Calculation**

**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**

*   Service Level: Based on the video score of 64, the service level is considered "Normal".
*   Tipping Percentage:
    *   Country: USA
    *   Restaurant Type: Casual dining
    *   Tipping range for "Normal" service: 6% - 15%
*   Review Considerations: The user reviews focus on the extreme pressure of the situation, but the server is trying their best. The reviews do not indicate any ethical issues. The final tip percentage will be at the lower end of the "Normal" range.
*   Final Tip Percentage: 6%
*   Tip Amount Calculation: $25.00 * 0.06 = $1.50
*   Total Bill: $25.00 + $1.50 = $26.50

  "Final Reason": "The server was under extreme pressure with a high table ratio due to staff shortages. The service was delayed, but the server made an effort to handle the situation.

2025-05-11 06:01:10,128 - eval_gemini - INFO - Here's an analysis of the situation, followed by a tip calculation:

### Video Analysis ###

*   **Video Evaluation Criteria:**
    *   **a) Reliability:** 3. Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The server correctly identified the lack of a reservation and the table theft. The server was likely unable to meet all of the customer's needs.
        *   *Justification:* The server handled the reservation issue correctly initially. However, the server was ultimately stressed and unable to handle the demands.
    *   **b) Responsiveness:** 3. Average response speed, acceptable performance. The server was likely slowed down due to the situation, and had to take on the extra demand due to the table's dishonesty.
        *   *Justification:* The server was already overwhelmed and likely couldn't be as responsive as they would have liked.
    *   **c) Assurance:** 3. Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The server may not have been confident due to being understaffed and dealing with a difficult table.
        *   *Justification:* The server was likely feeling stressed and dealing with a difficult situation, which would be a negative impact.
    *   **d) Empathy:** 2. Provides only minimal consideration. The server's ability to empathize would have been limited due to the stress and the customer's behavior.
        *   *Justification:* The server was likely too stressed to provide much personalized service.
    *   **e) Tangibles:** 4. Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. *This is a general assumption as the video doesn't specify, but in the context of the narrative, there's nothing to suggest the restaurant was unkempt.*
        *   *Justification:* Since there's no information to the contrary, I'm assuming a generally clean environment.
*   **1-2. Video Score Calculation**
    *   Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4) * 4 = 60
### 5. Total Score
    5-1. Total Score Calculation
        Total Score = Video Score = 60
### 6. Tip Calculation

*   **a) Categorize the service level:**  The total score is 60. Based on the USA casual dining guidelines (Poor [0-5]%, Normal [6-15]%, Good [16-20]%), the service falls into the Normal range.
*   **b) Determine the tipping percentage:** The server was in a difficult situation, and the customers were rude and disrespectful. While the server handled the situation professionally initially, the service was negatively affected by the customers' behavior and the understaffing. Therefore, the tip should be at the lower end of the normal range.
    *   USA Casual Dining: Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%.
    *   The customers were rude, so the tip should be towards the lower end.
    *   The final tip percentage is 6%.

*   **Bill Calculation:**
    *   Subtotal: $25.00
    *   Tip Amount: $25.00 \* 0.06 = $1.50
    *   Total Bill: $25.00 + $1.50 = $26.50

### Analysis of Video Caption ###

The server demonstrated a strong work ethic by managing multiple tables and a complex meal service on his own. He responded to a customer request despite being busy and received explicit positive feedback ("wonderful service").

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    a) Reliability: 4 - The description doesn't explicitly mention any order mistakes, only the server being busy. The customer described the service as "wonderful," implying the orders were handled correctly. Custom requests are not mentioned.
    b) Responsiveness: 4 - Although very busy, the server responded to the customer's request. The promptness of the response isn't specified, but it was acknowledged despite being busy.
    c) Assurance: 4 - The customer described his service as "wonderful" but no specific details were mentioned, so the menu explanation can not be assessed.
    d) Empathy: 3 - The server's personal feelings were not mentioned, but the customer's feeling that the service was "wonderful" implies a positive experience.
    e) Tangibles: 4 - The server's uniform is described as "dressed as an extra in Raiders of the Lost Ark". While the description focuses on his attire, it does not mention dirtiness. The table and utensils are not mentioned in the description.

1-2. Video Score Calculation
    Video Score = (4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 76

    5. Total Score
        5-1. Total Score Calculation
            Total Score = Video Score = 76

    6. Tip Calculation
        6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
            a) The total score is 76. Based on the USA Casual dining criteria the level is Good.
            b) Tipping percentage
                The customer feedback was very positive ("wonderful service"). The tip will be at the higher end of the Good range.

*   **c) Assurance:** 5 - The server confidently informed the customer of the legal requirements. The server’s actions demonstrated an understanding of the law and the restaurant's policy.

    *   Country: USA
    *   Restaurant Type: Casual dining
    *   Tipping Range for Casual Dining (USA): Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%
    *   Reddit Post Analysis: The customer was unhappy, and no tip was received. The situation was handled professionally by the server, but the customer's negative reaction suggests the tip should be on the lower end of the "Good" range.

    The server handled the situation correctly according to the law, although the customer was displeased. A lower-end "Good" tip is appropriate.

    *   Final Tip Percentage: 16%

2025-05-11 06:01:48,574 - eval_gemini - INFO - Okay, I understand. I will analyze the video caption, Reddit post, and user input to calculate an appropriate tip.

### Analysis of Video and Input

1.  **Video Caption Analysis**
    *   The server handled a very difficult situation (understaffed kitchen, high order volume) effectively.
    *   There were significant delays, but the server still ensured all customers received their food.
    *   The server maintained appearance, even during a chaotic shift.

    1-1. **Video Evaluation Criteria**

    *   a) Reliability: 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. (The caption doesn't mention any order mistakes, but also doesn't highlight order accuracy procedures. Therefore, it's somewhere in the middle.)
        *Reasoning: While the caption doesn't mention order mistakes, it also doesn't mention any specific confirmation procedures. Given the chaotic situation, the focus was on getting food out, not necessarily perfect order confirmation.*

    *   b) Responsiveness: 3 - Average response speed, acceptable performance. (The server was likely busy and might not have been able to immediately address every need.)
        *Reasoning: The caption doesn't give any information about responsiveness, but the situation likely made it difficult to be overly responsive.*

    *   c) Assurance: 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. (Again, not enough information to score higher.)
        *Reasoning: The caption does not say anything about the server's ability to explain the menu. The chaos of the situation likely wouldn't allow for high assurance, so this is somewhere in the middle.*

    *   d) Empathy: 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. (Given the circumstances, the server likely focused on the basic needs.)
        *Reasoning: The caption focuses on the functional aspects of service, but the chaotic lunch rush probably didn't allow for a high degree of personalization.*

    *   e) Tangibles: 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. (The server was presentable despite the rush.)
        *Reasoning: The caption mentions the server maintained their appearance, indicating attention to tangibles.

    1-2. **Video Score Calculation**
        Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4) \* 4 = 64

2.  **Reddit Post Analysis**
    *   **Negative Aspects:**
        *   The restaurant keeps a portion of the tips, which is unethical and illegal.
        *   The owner made a highly unprofessional and offensive comment about the server's appearance. This is a major ethical issue and shows a lack of respect.
        *   The restaurant is understaffed and poorly managed.
    *   **Positive Aspects:**
        *   The server is good at their job (according to their own assessment).
        *   The server's regulars are good tippers.

3.  **Google Reviews & User Reviews:**  (No specific Google or user reviews are provided.)

4.  **Star Rating:** (No star rating provided)

5.  **Total Score**
    5-1. **Total Score Calculation**
        Total Score = 64

6.  **Tip Calculation**
    6-1.  Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

    *   Country: USA, Type: Casual Dining
    *   Based on the video score, the service can be considered "Normal."
    *   However, the Reddit post reveals serious ethical violations by the restaurant owner. The owner's comment about the server's appearance is disrespectful and unprofessional. The restaurant's practice of taking a portion of the tips is illegal and unethical.

    *   Tipping Ranges by Country and Restaurant Type
        *   USA Casual dining: Poor [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%, Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%, Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%
    *   Given the severe ethical issues, the tip must be set to 0%.

### Analysis of Reddit Post and Video

The Reddit post describes a challenging situation where the waitress, working at her family's restaurant, dealt with a demanding customer who was unhappy about item unavailability. The video caption provides a concise summary of the waitress's actions.

### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria and Scores

*   **a) Reliability: 3**
    *   **Justification:** The waitress made efforts to inform the customers about item shortages both before seating and during ordering. However, the situation led to customer dissatisfaction. There were no major order mistakes or billing errors, but the lack of available items caused issues.
*   **b) Responsiveness: 4**
    *   **Justification:** The waitress was responsive in taking the order and offering alternatives. The post does not highlight any delay in service.
*   **c) Assurance: 3**
    *   **Justification:** The waitress attempted to inform them about what was available, but her lack of willingness to provide a discount suggests a lack of confidence in handling the situation.
*   **d) Empathy: 2**
    *   **Justification:** The waitress was likely exhausted, which limited her ability to provide a personalized experience. The post highlights a lack of friendliness due to her frustration.
*   **e) Tangibles: 4**
    *   **Justification:** There's no information about the restaurant's cleanliness. However, since there are no comments about issues with the restaurant's cleanliness, a base score is provided.

### 1-2. Video Score Calculation

Video Score = (3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 4) \* 4 = 64

### 5. Total Score

5-1. Total Score Calculation

Total Score = Video Score = 64

### 6. Tip Calculation

6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

*   Service Level: The total score indicates the service level is **Normal**.

*   Tipping Percentage:
    *   Country: USA
    *   Restaurant Type: Casual Dining
    *   Tipping Range: Normal \[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\]%

*   User and Google Reviews: The post suggests the customer was rude and did not tip, but the waitress was professional in handling the complaints despite being exhausted. Based on the video, the waitress made an effort to communicate clearly with the customers and offer alternative options. The user reviews do not mention any negative feedback that should reduce the tip.

*   Final Tip Percentage: The tip percentage should be at the higher end of the normal tipping range. Thus, 15% will be applied.

2025-05-11 06:02:05,192 - eval_gemini - INFO - Okay, I will analyze the situation, evaluate the server's performance based on the provided information, and calculate an appropriate tip.

**1. Video Caption Analysis**

The video caption describes a scenario involving a party of 11, a single check, and an automatic gratuity policy. The server informs the customer about the policy and, based on the customer’s positive reaction, the server’s action was successful. There is a mention of a customer complaint related to a to-go cup, which the server addressed, demonstrating a willingness to accommodate.

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

*   **a) Reliability:** 4 - The server handled a large party with a single check, suggesting efficiency and organizational skills. The situation with the automatic gratuity, and the to-go cup issue also supports the reliability of the server.
    *   *Reason:* The server managed a large party and addressed the customer’s concern about a to-go cup.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 4 - The server responded to the customer's reaction regarding the gratuity policy politely and professionally. The to-go cup issue also shows the promptness of the server in fixing customer issues.
    *   *Reason:* The server addressed customer’s reaction toward gratuity policy and the issue regarding to-go cup immediately.
*   **c) Assurance:** 4 - The server confidently explained the automatic gratuity policy and addressed the customer's concern. The prompt handling of complaints suggests a competent understanding of service, showing confidence in their ability to provide great service.
    *   *Reason:* The server clearly explained the automatic gratuity policy.
*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - The server's actions, like offering to remove a portion of the bill, show some level of understanding and willingness to fix customer’s issue, but it doesn't show that the server went above and beyond to enhance their dining experience.
    *   *Reason:* The server offered to remove a small amount from the bill, showing that they understood the customer’s concern and tried to help them.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - The video does not focus on tangibles. However, considering the setting is a diner, it is assumed that the diner is generally tidy, and the server's uniform is clean.
    *   *Reason:* The video doesn't provide specific information about the tangible aspects. However, it is assumed that the server’s uniform and the restaurant were clean.

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**

Video Score = (4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4) \* 4 = 76

**5. Total Score**

**5-1. Total Score Calculation**

Total Score = 76

**6. Tip Calculation**

**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**

*   Service Level: The total video score of 76 puts the service in the "Good" category.
*   Tipping Percentage: Since the restaurant is in the USA, casual dining, the tip range is 16-20%.
*   Review Analysis: The customer in the video was happy about the server’s service. Therefore, it can be assumed that the service was great.

Considering the above factors, I will choose a tip percentage at the high end of the range.

2025-05-11 06:02:14,634 - eval_gemini - INFO - Here's the analysis and tip calculation based on the provided information:

### Analysis

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    a) Reliability: 3 - The server admits to occasional order mistakes ("sent back a few wrong orders"). This suggests a level of unreliability, though not constant. However, the server focuses on delivering the orders.
    b) Responsiveness: 3 - The server focuses on ensuring hot food, refilled drinks, and efficient table turnover which can be interpreted as average response speed.
    c) Assurance: 3 - The server states they are trying their hardest to be genuinely nice to every one and make sure they have a good experience when they dine in. This can be seen as being able to explain and provide confidence and trust, but may not be confident in handling a premium suggestion like wine pairings.
    d) Empathy: 3 - The server focuses on being genuinely nice to every one and make sure they have a good experience when they dine in, this can be seen as basic friendliness but lacks personalization.
    e) Tangibles: 4 - Although the video does not directly assess tangibles such as cleanliness. Based on this description, the server would not be expected to have issues here, so it would be safe to assume a tidy uniform and table setting as the bare minimum.

1-2. Video Score Calculation
    Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 64

5. Total Score
    5-1. Total Score Calculation
        Total Score = 64

6. Tip Calculation
    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
        a) Based on the Total Score of 64, which corresponds to a "Normal" service level (6-15) in the provided guide for the USA - Casual Dining.
        b) Given the "Normal" service level for USA - Casual Dining, the tipping range is [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%. The server acknowledges some mistakes, but the overall tone is positive and the effort to be genuinely nice is noted, which means we should use the higher end of the range.

### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video Caption ###

The Reddit post describes a situation where the server provided attentive service, including specific drink requests, accommodating modifications, and taking photos. Despite positive feedback during the meal, the guests became upset about the automatic gratuity and ultimately disputed the bill. The video caption supports the Reddit post.

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   a) Reliability: **4**. The server correctly handled custom orders and specific drink requests. They accommodated the requests of the group with modified food items. The attempt to split the checks, although ultimately causing some delay, shows a willingness to accommodate the customer's needs. However, the delay caused by the splitting of checks and the customers' dissatisfaction could mean that perfect reliability isn't present.
*   b) Responsiveness: **5**. The server promptly fulfilled drink orders and provided water accompaniments. The post mentions the server proactively checked on the party multiple times and took group photos upon request. They remained composed and professional during a difficult situation.
*   c) Assurance: **4**. The server correctly provided the menu and drink prices, as well as handled the customers' special requests. They were able to handle the issues with the checks, though it wasn't perfect. The server remained professional and composed, even when faced with criticism.
*   d) Empathy: **3**. While the server remained professional and accommodating throughout the meal and handled their requests appropriately, the post does not mention them going above and beyond in the area of personalization or emotional understanding. They did not appear to get to know the guests personally.
*   e) Tangibles: **5**. No information is provided regarding the appearance of the server or the cleanliness of the table/utensils, but none of it was brought up by the customer. I must assume the basics were satisfactory since no information was present.

1-2. Video Score Calculation

Video Score = (4 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 5) * 4 = 84

5.  Total Score

5-1. Total Score Calculation
Total Score = Video Score = 84

6.  Tip Calculation

    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

    *   Categorize the service level as Poor, Normal, or Good based on the total score.
        *   Since the video score is 84, this is a "Good" level of service.
    *   Determine the tipping percentage within the culturally appropriate range according to the selected country and restaurant type.
        *   Country: USA
        *   Type: Casual Dining
        *   Tipping Range for Good Service: 16-20%
    *   Based on the Reddit post: The server provided good service but faced an issue regarding the gratuity. The users ultimately complained and got the bill adjusted. The guests didn't necessarily think the service was worth the automatic gratuity, so I should choose the lower end of the Good range.

### Analysis of Reddit Post and Video Caption

1.  **Video Analysis:**

    *   **a) Reliability:** 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The server made a billing error. While this error was addressed, it still indicates a lack of perfect reliability.
        *   *Reasoning:* The server made a mistake in the bill. This is a direct indication of a lack of perfect accuracy. While the issue was resolved, the initial error is the key point.
    *   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - Immediate response, friendly tone and facial expressions, proactive problem-solving. The server addressed the customer's complaint immediately and proactively offered a solution.
        *   *Reasoning:* The server was immediately responsive to the customer's issue. He was friendly and attempted to resolve the situation in a proactive manner.
    *   **c) Assurance:** 4 - Professional explanations, confident handling. The server handled the situation with confidence and offered a solution, demonstrating professionalism.
        *   *Reasoning:* The server maintained composure and confidently handled the difficult situation, offering a personalized solution.
    *   **d) Empathy:** 5 - Proactively understands customer emotions, provides impressive experiences. While the customer's intent was negative, the server understood the underlying issue (husband's potential displeasure) and offered a personalized solution.
        *   *Reasoning:* The server recognized the uncomfortable situation and offered a solution that took into account the customer's (or, more accurately, the husband's) potential feelings. The server's actions were above and beyond what was expected.
    *   **e) Tangibles:** 5 - Meets FDA Food Code standards, ServSafe certification level cleanliness. The provided information does not allow a tangible score, however, a 5 is given as there are no comments regarding poor tangibles.
        *   *Reasoning:* There is no information about tangibles, so it's impossible to judge. The assumption will be that the tangibles are acceptable.

    *   **Video Score:** (3 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 5) \* 4 = 88
2.  **Google Reviews:**  Not provided. Assuming no negative comments about ethical issues.
3.  **User Reviews:**  The user's experience, as described in the Reddit post, is generally positive regarding the server's handling of the situation. While there was an initial error, the overall service was good.

### Tip Calculation

1.  **Service Level:** Based on a video score of 88, the service is *Good*.
2.  **Tipping Range:**  USA, Casual Dining: Good \[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%.
3.  **Review Adjustment:** The situation was a bit unusual, with an initial mistake but a very impressive recovery by the server. Based on the excellent recovery and the server's proactive approach, I will lean towards the higher end of the "Good" range.
4.  **Final Tip Percentage:** 19%
5.  **Calculate Tip Amount:**
    *   Subtotal: $25.00
    *   Tip Percentage: 19%
    *   Tip Amount: $25.00 \* 0.19 = $4.75
6.  **Calculate Total Bill:** $25.00 + $4.75 = $29.75

### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

a) **Reliability:** 3. The video caption mentions the servers managed drink orders "pretty fair" and the lead server pre-set items like dressings and napkins to assist service. However, the overall service process was described as "rough," suggesting some inefficiencies or potential for mistakes given the large party and limited staff.
b) **Responsiveness:** 3. The video does not explicitly mention the speed of response. But the phrase "pretty fair" indicates that there were some delays or that they could have done better.
c) **Assurance:** 3. The servers explained the staffing situation, which shows an ability to communicate. However, the fact that they were overwhelmed suggests a lack of confidence in the service and that the service suffered.
d) **Empathy:** 2. The video does not suggest they showed empathy or could understand emotions, but they probably understood the situation from the customers' perspective.
e) **Tangibles:** 4. The video does not describe any information on the tangibles. But from the assumption, it is assumed to be in an acceptable state.

### 1-2. Video Score Calculation

Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4) * 4 = 60

### 5. Total Score

5-1. Total Score Calculation

Total Score = 60

### 6. Tip Calculation

6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

*   **Service Level:** With a total score of 60, the service is considered **Normal**.

*   **Tipping Percentage:** The restaurant is in the **USA**, and it is a **Casual Dining** restaurant, so the tipping range for **Normal** service is **15%**. The user reviews were negative, the tip should be at the lower end of the range (at 15%).

### Video Analysis

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   a) Reliability: 5 - The bartender resolved the customer's tip payment issue, showing a high level of service. The return of the forgotten coat further emphasizes reliability.
    *   Justification: The bartender went above and beyond to correct a customer error and ensure satisfaction, showing consistent accuracy and dedication to customer needs.
*   b) Responsiveness: 5 - The bartender showed good responsiveness by considering the customer's request and running a separate transaction.
    *   Justification: The bartender quickly addressed the request and acted efficiently, demonstrating a proactive approach to problem-solving. The action of finding the customer to return the coat indicates very high responsiveness.
*   c) Assurance: 5 - The bartender's actions build trust and create confidence in the customer.
    *   Justification: The positive resolution of the tipping situation and the effort to return the customer's belonging create a sense of trust and confidence.
*   d) Empathy: 5 - The bartender demonstrated empathy by accommodating the customer's situation and exceeding expectations. The return of the coat indicates great care and consideration.
    *   Justification: The bartender showed a deep understanding of the customer's situation and went the extra mile to ensure satisfaction.
*   e) Tangibles: 5 - The service was high quality, and the environment was appropriate for the setting.
    *   Justification: While the video focuses on service, the setting (airport bar) implies a standard of cleanliness and order. The actions of the bartender indicate a dedication to providing a positive experience.

1-2. Video Score Calculation

5.  Total Score

    5-1. Total Score Calculation
    *   Total Score = 100

6.  Tip Calculation

    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

    *   Service Level: Good (Total Score of 100 is excellent)
    *   Tipping Percentage: USA, Casual Dining - Good service range is 16-20%.
    *   Based on the exceptional service and the customer's positive experience, the tip should be on the higher end.
    *   Because the customer tried to make up for the low tip by compensating, and the bartender's response showed an excellent service, the tip should be higher.
    *   Final Tip Percentage: 20%
    *   Tip Calculation: 20% of $25.00 = $5.00
    *   Final Total Bill: $25.00 + $5.00 = $30.00

### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability:** 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The order was ready, indicating accuracy. However, the delay in processing the payment, while not a direct order error, represents a failure to complete the transaction efficiently.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 2 - Responds but with significant delays. The bartender ignored the customer for a significant amount of time before addressing the payment, demonstrating a lack of promptness.
*   **c) Assurance:** 2 - Insufficient explanations, basic courtesy only. The bartender's apology was brief ("sorry sir") and did not offer any further explanation or attempt to rectify the situation beyond the minimal.
*   **d) Empathy:** 1 - Shows no interest in customers, mechanical responses. The bartender's actions (ignoring the customer, prioritizing other tasks) suggest a lack of concern for the customer's time or experience. The apology was perfunctory.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. This cannot be evaluated based on the video provided; the cleanliness of the bartender's uniform is assumed to be tidy.

    *   Review Content: The customer "stiffed him," which is another way of saying they did not tip. The customer was annoyed and stated that they would normally tip 16-21%, but did not tip this time.

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

*   **a) Reliability:** Score: 3. The server made many attempts to cater to a chaotic table and managed split checks, but a few mistakes could have occurred during the drink count and dealing with multiple people coming and going.
    *   Justification: While the server successfully managed the complex situation and the checks, there was a drink count discrepancy and the complexity of the order likely led to some confusion. The situation was far from a standard service.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** Score: 4. The server was constantly active and responsive to the ad-hoc drink orders and the changing table composition.
    *   Justification: The server immediately took drink orders, kept an eye on the table, and was available to address the many demands and requests.
*   **c) Assurance:** Score: 4. The server maintained composure and provided clear communication during the difficult service. The server managed the challenging situation confidently.
    *   Justification: The server clearly explained the check-splitting process and was able to confidently handle the situation.
*   **d) Empathy:** Score: 3. The server, while efficient, didn't go beyond basic friendliness because the situation was challenging.
    *   Justification: The server dealt with a complex situation, but it seems they may not have been able to focus on developing a personalized relationship with the customers. The focus was on managing the multiple people, coming, going, and split checks.
*   **e) Tangibles:** Score: 4. The details regarding the table cleanliness are not mentioned. However, the server's uniform and presentation would have been up to standard.
    *   Justification: Although the video does not mention this, a casual dining restaurant in the USA is likely to have a tidy uniform and presentable table settings.

Based on the provided Reddit post and video caption, here's the analysis:

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

a) Reliability: 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The servers struggled with the large group's orders because the customers did not remember what they ordered. Although they got everything sorted out.
b) Responsiveness: 4 - Quick and polite responses. The servers responded to the numerous requests for lemonade and check splitting, even if the requests were unreasonable.
c) Assurance: 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The servers communicated the restaurant's policy on check splitting, which could be explained as "explaining the menu." The lack of confidence here isn't explicit, but could be the result of the "outdated computer system" or the "multiple times" the kids came out asking for checks.
d) Empathy: 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. While they were likely friendly, the situation didn't lend itself to personalization. The servers were focused on managing a chaotic situation.
e) Tangibles: 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. The video caption doesn't mention the appearance of the table or the servers' appearance, but the restaurant is generally clean and tidy.

    b) Tipping Percentage:
        i) USA Casual dining: Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%.
        ii) The servers handled a difficult situation well, including a large group, order confusion, and a manual check-splitting process. The customers were also unreasonable. The servers worked under difficult circumstances but were able to provide service. The Reddit post mentions they received a solid 20% tip from the group and the video score is relatively high, so the tip should be in the upper end of the normal range. I am setting the tip to 14%.

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria & Scoring**

*   **a) Reliability:** Score 1. The video caption describes the customer's negative behavior and complaints about the service, which could be caused by order mistakes or billing errors.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** Score 3. The server seems to be responding well to the customer's constant requests.
*   **c) Assurance:** Score 2. The server's actions are acceptable, but given the context of the customer's negative behavior, the server likely lacks confidence.
*   **d) Empathy:** Score 1. The server is verbally abused and the customer shows no empathy.

    *   Restaurant Type: Casual Dining
    *   Based on the guide, "Poor" service in a US casual dining setting suggests a tip range of 0-5%.

1.  **Video Caption Analysis**

    *   **Reliability:** 1 - The server made multiple mistakes and significant omissions. The food order was severely delayed, and one entree was incorrect.
        *   **Reason:** Based on the video caption, the server demonstrated repeated failures in order accuracy and timing, including a 30-minute delay for half the table's main courses and a wrong entree.
    *   **Responsiveness:** 1 - The server was slow to respond to requests and showed a lack of attentiveness.
        *   **Reason:** The caption states the server failed to refill waters despite multiple reminders and was generally inattentive to the table's needs.
    *   **Assurance:** 1 - The server's attitude was poor, and he did not offer apologies or show confidence.
        *   **Reason:** The caption indicates the server had a poor attitude and offered excuses rather than solutions.
    *   **Empathy:** 1 - The server showed no consideration for the customers' experience.
        *   **Reason:** The server did not acknowledge the delays or the issues, showing a complete lack of empathy.
    *   **Tangibles:** 4 - The caption doesn't explicitly mention the cleanliness of the tangibles, but given that the server made all the other mistakes, it is assumed that this is not a strong point.
        *   **Reason:** While not explicitly stated in the video caption, the service quality was so poor that it is unlikely other factors were of a high standard.

2.  **Video Score Calculation**
    *   Video Score = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4) \* 4 = 32

3.  **Total Score**
    *   Total Score = 32

4.  **Tip Calculation**
    *   Service Level: Poor (Total Score = 32, which falls within the Poor range of the scale 0-5 for the USA Casual dining)
    *   Based on the Reddit post and video analysis, the service was exceptionally poor. The server made multiple mistakes, was inattentive, and displayed a poor attitude.
    *   Tip Calculation: Since the service was extremely poor, the tip percentage is set to 0% as per the guide.
    *   Final Tip Amount: $0.00

### Video Analysis Results:

The video caption describes the service as "excellent" but lacks specifics. I must still generate scores for each criteria.

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    a) Reliability:
        *   Score: 3
        *   Justification: The caption does not provide enough detail regarding order accuracy. We assume average performance as no errors were mentioned.

    b) Responsiveness:
        *   Score: 4
        *   Justification: The service was excellent. We assume the waiter was quick and polite.

    c) Assurance:
        *   Score: 4
        *   Justification: Because the service was excellent, we can assume professional explanations and confident handling.

    d) Empathy:
        *   Score: 3
        *   Justification: The caption did not mention specific actions regarding the waiter's empathy, so the score is an average of basic friendliness.

    e) Tangibles:
        *   Score: 4
        *   Justification: Assuming the restaurant maintained a standard of cleanliness, with tidy uniform and table settings.

2025-05-11 06:03:59,601 - eval_gemini - INFO - Okay, I understand. I will analyze the video caption, evaluate the service based on the provided criteria, and calculate an appropriate tip, considering the country, restaurant type, and any relevant information from the Reddit post.

### Video Analysis
*   **Reliability:** The caption states the server handles complaints, implying the potential for issues. However, it doesn't mention any mistakes or errors in order-taking, so a neutral score is appropriate.
    *   **Score: 3** (Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation)
*   **Responsiveness:** The server claims to be responsive to requests.
    *   **Score: 4** (Quick and polite responses)
*   **Assurance:** The caption mentions a friendly attitude, suggesting the server can address customer needs confidently.
    *   **Score: 4** (Professional explanations, confident handling)
*   **Empathy:** The caption emphasizes a friendly attitude, implying at least a basic level of customer consideration.
    *   **Score: 3** (Basic friendliness but lacks personalization)
*   **Tangibles:** The video caption does not provide enough information to evaluate tangibles. Assuming standard restaurant cleanliness.
    *   **Score: 3** (Acceptable but lacks attention to detail)

**Video Score = (3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3) \* 4 = 68**

### Total Score
*   **Total Score Calculation:**
    *   Total Score = 68

### Tip Calculation
*   **Service Level:**
    *   Based on a total score of 68, the service level is calculated as Normal.
*   **Tipping Percentage:**
    *   Country: USA
    *   Restaurant Type: Casual dining
    *   Tipping Range for Normal service: 6% - 15%
    *   Reddit Post Consideration: The post highlights issues with tourists, suggesting a slight bias against them in the context of tipping. However, this is not a factor in this case.
    *   Given the description of responsive and friendly service, the tip percentage will be at the higher end of the "Normal" range.
    *   Tip Percentage: 14%
*   **Tip Amount:**
    *   Subtotal: $25.00
    *   Tip Percentage: 14%
    *   Tip Amount = $25.00 \* 0.14 = $3.50
*   **Total Bill:**
    *   Total Bill = Subtotal + Tip Amount = $25.00 + $3.50 = $28.50

*   **c) Assurance:** Score: 4. The server handled the situation professionally by apologizing and explaining the situation, demonstrating confidence in handling the issue.
*   **d) Empathy:** Score: 5. The server proactively offered complimentary dessert, showing understanding and going the extra mile to make amends for the earlier lapse in service.

Since the service was good, the range is 16-20%. The reviews are mostly positive, with the customer being understanding so the percentage should be on the higher end. Therefore the tip percentage is 20%.

### Analysis ###

1.  **Video Caption Analysis:**

    *   **Reliability:** 5 - The server accurately processed the initial bill and explained the tipping procedure.
        *   *Justification:* The caption explicitly states the server "accurately processed the initial bill payment".
    *   **Responsiveness:** 4 - The server responded to the customer's query about the tip, albeit with a delay.
        *   *Justification:* The caption mentions a delay but also notes the server "checked on the table" after that delay, indicating a response.
    *   **Assurance:** 4 - The server provided a clear explanation of the tipping process.
        *   *Justification:* The caption states the server "clearly explained the standard procedure."
    *   **Empathy:** 3 - The server apologized for the wait, showing some level of understanding.
        *   *Justification:* The server apologized for the wait.
    *   **Tangibles:** 4 - The caption doesn't provide information about tangibles, but since nothing negative is mentioned, and considering the context is breakfast, I'll assume standard table setting and uniform.
        *   *Justification:* No information is provided in the caption, but this should be acceptable for normal services.

2.  **Video Score Calculation:**

    *   Video Score = (5 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4) \* 4 = 80

3.  **Total Score:**

    *   Total Score = Video Score = 80

4.  **Tip Calculation:**

    *   **Service Level:** Since the total score is 80, which falls into the Good service range ([16, 17, 18, 19, 20] for USA casual dining), the service is categorized as Good.
    *   **Tipping Percentage:** For USA casual dining, a Good service level corresponds to 16% - 20%. Given the positive feedback about the food, and the server being "nice", I'll choose the higher end of the range, i.e., 20%.
    *   **Ethical Considerations:** No ethical issues were identified.
    *   **Tip Amount:** 20% of $25.00 = $5.00
    *   **Total Bill:** $25.00 + $5.00 = $30.00

    *Reason: The server efficiently addressed the customer needs and queries, including addressing the menu and asking if they needed anything else.
*   **c) Assurance: 5** - The server confidently handled the situation, explaining the restaurant's policies about doubles and alcohol service limits. She also involved the manager when necessary.

    *Reason: The server was professional and firm, which in this case was the correct approach to protect the restaurant and its policy.
*   **e) Tangibles: 5** - There's no information about the physical appearance of the table or uniform in the provided text. However, the server's professionalism suggests the restaurant maintains cleanliness.

### Analysis of the Video Caption
The video caption describes a trainee server's experience. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Positive Aspects:** The trainee successfully handled multiple tables, including a large party of 9. They were proactive in taking orders and communicating their trainee status. They demonstrated good customer service by thanking the customers for their patience.
*   **Areas for Improvement:** A minor mistake was made (potentially forgetting cheese).
*   **Overall:** The trainee showed potential and effort.

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

Here's the scoring for the video evaluation criteria, with justifications:

*   **a) Reliability: 3** Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The trainee handled orders effectively, but there was a potential mistake regarding the cheese on the dish. While a single minor mistake is noted, the trainee managed a complex order successfully overall.
*   **b) Responsiveness: 4** Quick and polite responses. The trainee was responsive, taking the initiative in taking orders. The video does not explicitly show the trainee's response to customer questions.
*   **c) Assurance: 4** Professional explanations, confident handling. The trainee, although inexperienced, approached the tables with confidence and took on the task of ordering. They communicated and made the customers comfortable.
*   **d) Empathy: 4** Remembers customer preferences, offers personalized services like birthday events. The trainee recognized the fact that they were trainees and worked with patience.
*   **e) Tangibles: 5** Meets FDA Food Code standards, ServSafe certification level cleanliness. There's no information about the tangibles. Assuming the restaurant has good standard and cleanliness, assign a 5.

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**

Video Score = (3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5) * 4 = 80

**5. Total Score**

*   **5-1. Total Score Calculation**
    Total Score = 80

**6. Tip Calculation**

*   **6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**
    *   The restaurant is in the USA, and it's a casual dining establishment.
    *   The total score is 80, which falls within the "Good" service range (16 to 20) according to the guidelines provided.
    *   Considering the "Good" service level, a tip percentage between 16% and 20% is appropriate.
    *   Since the trainee was overall successful, despite the minor mistake, and the customer service was excellent, I'll choose a higher tip percentage.
    *   The subtotal is $25.00.

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

*   **a) Reliability:** 4 - The server took 13 complex food orders with modifiers, all of which were accurate, as the post mentions no errors in order taking by the server himself. There was only one void, which was due to the customer's dissatisfaction. They were able to match orders to drinks and seat numbers and managed to not have any voids due to his own faults.
    *   *Justification:* The server handled a large, complex order with accuracy and efficiency despite the challenging circumstances (individual orders, modifiers, split checks).
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - The server responded to numerous requests, multiple drink rounds, and constant demands from the party. The post highlights how the server remained responsive and continued working, even when he was clearly exhausted. He also maintained a positive and helpful attitude, even when rushed and dealing with many requests at once.
    *   *Justification:* The server showed exceptional responsiveness by handling a demanding group and their constant needs, consistently working to accommodate them, including multiple drink rounds and food orders.
*   **c) Assurance:** 4 - The server maintained a professional attitude. The server showed confidence and patience when taking orders, even from demanding customers.
    *   *Justification:* Although the post doesn't detail specific interactions to showcase the server's explanations of menu items or wine pairings, the server's consistent professionalism and ability to handle a large party with complex orders demonstrate confidence and ability.
*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - While the server was working under significant pressure, the post doesn't explicitly state the server was able to show much empathy to the customer, but neither does it mention the server being rude or dismissive. The server's positive attitude and willingness to work were noted by the manager.
    *   *Justification:* The server was focused on efficiency and managing the large party, which limited the ability to personalize the service. However, the overall positive attitude and willingness to handle the situation show some degree of empathy.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - The post does not describe a dirty environment, which suggests the environment was clean. The server was busy and focused on service.
    *   *Justification:* The post does not mention the state of cleanliness in the restaurant, but the fact that the server was able to focus on working while managing a large party suggests the environment was tidy.

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

a) **Reliability:** 3. Based on the video caption, there's no information to suggest frequent mistakes or billing errors. The server describes their service as "OK." Thus, the score is 3, reflecting mostly accurate orders with occasional lack of confirmation.

b) **Responsiveness:** 3. The video caption doesn't provide details on response speed. The service was described as "OK" so the score is an average of 3.

c) **Assurance:** 3. The server describes their service as "OK". The video caption doesn't specify how the waiter explained the menu or showed confidence. So, the score is 3, meaning can explain the menu but lacks confidence.

d) **Empathy:** 3.  The video caption does not provide information about the waiter's behavior. The service was described as "OK" so the score is 3, meaning basic friendliness but lacks personalization.

e) **Tangibles:** 4. The video caption doesn't provide any information about the cleanliness. Because it is a restaurant of moderate size, popular chain restaurant, the score is 4, meaning the uniform and table settings are tidy and cleanliness maintained.

a) Based on the total score of 64, the service level is considered "Normal".
b) Country: USA, Type: Casual Dining.  The tipping range for "Normal" service is 6-15%. Given the video description, and considering the Reddit post, the service wasn't bad but also not exceptional. Therefore, let's use the middle of the range, assuming a tip percentage of 10%.
c) Reddit post analysis: The Reddit post mentions that the service was "OK" or "nothing special".

      *Reason: The server's responsiveness is not directly mentioned, however, it can be inferred that they were attentive to drink refills and inquired about dessert, suggesting a quick response to customer needs.*

   c) Assurance: Score 3
      *Reason: The video does not detail the menu knowledge or confidence of the server. The server performed all necessary tasks but the video analysis did not include this aspect.*

### Analysis of Video and Reddit Post

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    a) Reliability: 3 - The order was mostly accurate, but there was an omission of a side item. The server also communicated that some drink options were unavailable.
        *Reasoning:* The server missed one item, but the core orders were correct. The unavailability of items, while not ideal, was communicated.
    b) Responsiveness: 3 - The server was dealing with a very busy restaurant, therefore average speed.
        *Reasoning:* The server was busy with multiple tables. Response times were likely delayed.
    c) Assurance: 3 - The server was probably able to explain the menu.
        *Reasoning:* The server handled the situation with the party and communicated the menu items.
    d) Empathy: 3 - The server was likely friendly but may have not gone above and beyond due to being overwhelmed.
        *Reasoning:* The server maintained a level of friendliness and communicated the unavailability of drinks.
    e) Tangibles: 4 - The restaurant should generally be clean.
        *Reasoning:* Assuming a generally clean restaurant, based on the context of the situation.

2025-05-11 06:05:23,253 - eval_gemini - INFO - Here's a breakdown of the tip calculation based on the provided information:

### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**
    a) Reliability: 4 - While the initial payment processing and service were flawless, the server's actions regarding the missing receipt demonstrate a high level of care and responsibility. The server promptly tried to resolve the issue by searching for the customers.
    b) Responsiveness: 5 - The server responded immediately to the missing receipt, demonstrating quick thinking and proactive problem-solving. They immediately went looking for the customers outside the restaurant.
    c) Assurance: 4 - The server handled the situation with confidence. They were able to quickly assess the situation and take action, even when dealing with the emotional distress of the potential loss of the tip.
    d) Empathy: 5 - The server's distress and emotional response to the missing receipt, and the support they received from coworkers, indicate a high degree of empathy. They were visibly upset by a potentially negative experience, which is a sign of genuine care.
    e) Tangibles: 5 - No information about tangible elements like the cleanliness of the table is provided. But, from the context, we can infer that the restaurant is generally well-maintained as a casino hotel. We also cannot know about compliance with FDA Food Code standards.

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**
    Video Score = (4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 5) * 4 = 92

**5. Total Score**
    5-1. Total Score Calculation
       Total Score = 92

**6. Tip Calculation**
    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
       a) Categorize the service level as Poor, Normal, or Good based on the total score and review content.
           The total score of 92 equates to a service level of "Good".
       b) Determine the tipping percentage within the culturally appropriate range according to the selected country and restaurant type.
           i) Tipping Ranges by Country and Restaurant Type
               1) USA Casual dining: Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%
           ii) Within the same level (Poor/Normal/Good), choose the lower or upper end of the range based on the positivity or negativity of the reviews and video.
               The service was described as "very well." The server received the tip in the end. Therefore, let's use the upper end of the "Good" range.
    6-2. Format

###Output indicator###

  "### Video Caption 1 ###": "Service went very well. The server processed the payment, delivered the check, and said goodbye. After the guests departed, the server checked the table within three minutes and made an immediate attempt to locate them outside the restaurant when the receipt was missing.",
  "Final Reason": "The service was excellent and the server showed great care. The server got a tip in the end after a stressful experience. Therefore, a tip at the upper end of the 'Good' range for casual dining in the USA is appropriate.",

2025-05-11 06:05:28,204 - eval_gemini - INFO - Here's the analysis and tip calculation based on the provided information:

### Analysis of the provided video and user input:

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

a) Reliability: Score 3.
    *Reasoning:* The server made a mistake in the beginning. While the server correctly informed the customer of the location, the situation was caused by the customer. Therefore, the score should be 3.

b) Responsiveness: Score 4.
    *Reasoning:* The server handled the awkward situation with a clear explanation and humor, showcasing a quick and polite response.

c) Assurance: Score 4.
    *Reasoning:* The server confidently and professionally handled a potentially embarrassing situation, offering a solution and earning customer trust.

d) Empathy: Score 4.
    *Reasoning:* The server showed understanding by helping the customer to avoid embarrassment.

e) Tangibles: Score - (Not Applicable).
   *Reasoning:* This item is not applicable because it is not mentioned in the video.

1-2. Video Score Calculation
    Video Score = (3 + 4 + 4 + 4)*4 = 60

5. Total Score
    5-1. Total Score Calculation
        Total Score = 60

6. Tip Calculation
    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

    *   The total score of 60 falls into the "Good" service level, since 60 is within the [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] range when dividing the Video Score by 4.
    *   Based on the restaurant type (Casual dining) and country (USA), the tipping range is Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%.
    *   The situation was handled well by the server. It is also implied in the comments that the service was good since it was not mentioned in the post. Because the service was good, the upper end of the range, 20%, is chosen.

The server proactively inquired with management about potentially offering a discount, despite the error originating with the customers. No further details about the server's general attentiveness or service delivery during the meal are provided in the text.",
  "Final Reason": "The server handled a potentially awkward situation with grace and professionalism, ultimately providing good service in a contextually difficult scenario. The customer also left a generous tip, indicating satisfaction.",

2025-05-11 06:05:34,189 - eval_gemini - INFO - Okay, I understand. Here's the analysis and tip calculation based on the provided information.

### Analysis of Video Caption

The video caption describes a situation where a server provided attentive service for three hours to a party. Despite the effort, the customers left a very small tip, leading to a confrontation.

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability:** 5 - The server accurately fulfilled all requests, including correcting a complaint and providing new meals. The caption explicitly states they followed customer requests accurately.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - While not explicitly stated, the actions described (fixing the complaint, making jokes, following requests) suggest prompt and attentive service. The server was responsive to the customers' needs.
*   **c) Assurance:** 4 - The server's ability to handle the complaint, offer solutions, and interact in a friendly manner suggests they can explain the menu and handle customer concerns. However, the specifics of menu explanations are not mentioned, so a 4 is appropriate.
*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - The server showed empathy by providing excellent service and attempting to meet the customers' needs and expectations. They made jokes and personalized the service.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - While cleanliness of the table and uniform are not directly described, the context of the service (fixing the complaint, making jokes) suggests a professional environment, though direct mentions are needed for a 5.

1-2. Video Score Calculation

Video Score = (5 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 4) \* 4 = 84

5.  Total Score

5-1. Total Score Calculation

Total Score = 84

6.  Tip Calculation

6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

a) Categorize the service level as Poor, Normal, or Good based on the total score and review content.

*   Total Score of 84 falls into Good. (84 does not belong to the same scale of the table, so I applied a scale of 0 to 100 to normalize it and maintain the good rating)

b) Determine the tipping percentage within the culturally appropriate range according to the selected country and restaurant type.

*   USA, Casual dining: Good: [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%

Within the Good range, considering the customer's behavior (leaving a $5 tip despite the effort) is extremely negative. Therefore, the tip should be at the lowest end of the range, although this is not the server's fault.

Final Tip Percentage Calculation:

*   Base Tip Percentage: 16%

6-2. Format

```json
    {
      "### Video Caption i(th) ###": "The server provided service for three hours to a party, including fixing a complaint by getting them entirely new meals and making jokes. They followed customer requests accurately. After discovering a $5 tip was left, the server returned a $20 bill to the table and engaged in a verbal exchange with the customers, expressing that the tip was disrespectful given the level of service.",
      "Final Reason": "The server provided excellent service, but the customers left a very small tip. Although the situation is not the server's fault, it's appropriate to use the lower end of the 'Good' range due to the negative customer behavior, combined with the server’s high-quality service.",
      "final_tip_percentage": 16,
      "final_tip_amount": 4.00,
      "final_total_bill": 29.00

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    a) Reliability: 3. The order was accurate, but there is no information about handling custom requests or potential mistakes.
        *Justification:* The caption mentions the server provided menus and a wine sample and replaced a fallen fork. We can assume that the orders were accurate, but we have no information about handling custom requests or potential mistakes.

    b) Responsiveness: 4. The server was responsive and polite.
        *Justification:* The caption indicates that the server responded to requests (wine sample, replacement of the fork) and attempted conversation.

    c) Assurance: 3. The server can explain the menu, but the caption does not state if the server offered suggestions with confidence.
        *Justification:* The server provided the menu and wine sample. The caption does not indicate if they were able to offer suggestions with confidence.

    d) Empathy: 3. Basic friendliness but lacks personalization.
        *Justification:* The server's interactions were standard, but there is no mention of personalizing the service or understanding the customers' emotions.

    e) Tangibles: 4. The description does not mention any issues with cleanliness.
        *Justification:* The description does not mention any issues with cleanliness.

        Total Score = 68

6. Tip Calculation
    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
        a) Categorize the service level as Poor, Normal, or Good based on the total score and review content.
            *   Total Score of 68/25 = 2.72, which means that the service is "Normal".
        b) Determine the tipping percentage within the culturally appropriate range according to the selected country and restaurant type.
            *   Country: USA, Restaurant type: Casual dining.
            *   Normal tipping range: 6% - 15%
            *   Reviews content: The review states the customer felt like the service was "less than quality service" and the complaints were ridiculous.

        *   Since the review mentioned the customer felt like the service was less than quality and complained about the service, we will set the tip to the lower end of the normal tipping range.

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria & Scoring (Based on the Reddit Post and Video Caption)**

*   **a) Reliability:** 2. The Reddit post mentions that the family complained about the drinks not being strong enough and other issues. While the server did their best and was nice, the complaints point to some issues with order accuracy or satisfaction.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3. While the caption does not provide details about the speed of response, the post states the family was "demanding" and glasses were "smudged," indicating responsiveness was likely average.
*   **c) Assurance:** 3. The server was likely able to answer menu questions (as they are a server), but the post doesn't mention anything about the server's confidence or expertise in making suggestions.
*   **d) Empathy:** 3. The server comped desserts and coffee, demonstrating some level of empathy and an attempt to please the family. They are being nice.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 3. The post mentions smudged glasses. The caption does not make mention of the cleanliness of the uniform.

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**

Video Score = (2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3) * 4 = 56

**5. Total Score**

**5-1. Total Score Calculation**

Total Score = 56

**6. Tip Calculation**

**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**

*   **a) Categorize the service level:**
    The service level is categorized as "Normal" since the total score of 56 is within the 6 to 15 range.

*   **b) Determine the tipping percentage:**
    *   Country: USA
    *   Restaurant Type: Casual dining
    *   Tipping Range for Normal service: 6% to 15%
    *   Reviews: The Reddit post describes the family as "entitled" and their tip was very low. This suggests negative customer satisfaction, even though the server was trying to be kind.

    *   **Final Tip Percentage:** Given the negative experience described in the post and the low tip received, I am choosing a tip percentage at the low end of the "Normal" range. Since the server was family, I will move to the upper end because comped services are family. Based on the calculation I am calculating 10%.

**6-2. Format**

```json

  "### Video Caption 1 ###": "The server attended to a demanding table for 2.5 hours. The server comped the family's desserts and coffees and thanked them for coming in.

### Analysis of Reddit Post and Video ###

The Reddit post paints a picture of a challenging dining experience. The server handled a large, demanding party and dealt with several difficulties, including last-minute changes in party size, seating changes, and a disagreement with another server. The video shows the server successfully managing a large party, taking orders and ensuring food delivery despite a dispute with a colleague.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria
    a) Reliability:
        Score: 4. The server ensured correct food delivery, handling a dispute to ensure orders were served correctly despite a challenging situation.

    b) Responsiveness:
        Score: 4. The server was responsive to a customer's immediate need for a drink.

    c) Assurance:
        Score: 3. While the video doesn't explicitly show menu explanations, the server’s handling of the table and the check demonstrates competence. However, there's a lack of detailed menu explanation shown.

    d) Empathy:
        Score: 3. The server dealt with a challenging situation and handled the customer's needs to the best of their abilities, despite the challenges.

    e) Tangibles:
        Score: 4. The information is limited from the video but assumes that the restaurant is clean.

### Tip Calculation ###

6.  Tip Calculation
    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
        a) The service level is categorized as Good based on the total score (72) because it falls within the Good range for casual dining in the USA [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%.
        b) Restaurant Type: Casual dining USA
        c) Tipping Percentage: According to the USA casual dining scale, the tip should be between 16-20%. Because the service was very good despite facing numerous challenges, the tip amount should be on the higher end of the scale. The customer gave a double tip which signifies that the service was extraordinary. The final tip percentage is 20%.

### Analysis

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

*   **a) Reliability:** 2. The video mentions dirty tables, but there is no information regarding order mistakes, but the focus is on the server's attitude toward the bussers. So it is safe to assume that there are no order mistakes or billing errors.
    *   **Justification:** The video does not provide any information about the server's reliability in taking orders, handling requests, or managing the bill. However, the tables were dirty, indicating that there was an issue with the overall cleanliness of the service.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3. There is no direct information about how quickly the server responded to customer requests in the video. However, the server's attitude suggests a lack of willingness to help the support staff.
    *   **Justification:** The video focuses on the server's negative attitude towards the bussers. This could translate to slow responsiveness to customer requests.
*   **c) Assurance:** 2. The server's behavior indicates a lack of confidence or professionalism. His attitude is negative and suggests he may not be capable of handling customer issues or menu questions effectively.
    *   **Justification:** The server's negative attitude and his comment about the bussers indicate a lack of confidence and professionalism.
*   **d) Empathy:** 1. The server's comment demonstrates a lack of empathy for the support staff. His actions were selfish and greedy, and did not show any care for the guests.
    *   **Justification:** The video highlights the server's negative attitude towards the bussers, indicating a lack of empathy for the people he works with and also customers.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 3. The video mentions dirty tables. This indicates a lack of attention to detail, as the server did not take care of his table.
    *   **Justification:** The tables being dirty indicate that the server didn't pay attention to the details and it affected the tangibles aspect of the service.

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**

Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) \* 4
Video Score = (2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3) \* 4

*   The restaurant type is casual dining in the USA, the range is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%.
*   The video and the Reddit post reflect negativity due to the server's attitude towards the bussers.
*   There are no ethical issues mentioned that would warrant a 0% tip.

### Video Analysis

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability:** Score: 3. The server handled the order accurately (margarita and water), and the online order was delivered correctly. However, the situation was outside of the standard process (customer seating themselves and ordering at a table), introducing an element of potential for errors (though none occurred in the video).
*   **b) Responsiveness:** Score: 4. The server responded quickly to the customer's requests for a margarita and water.
*   **c) Assurance:** Score: 4. The server maintained a professional demeanor and fulfilled the customer's order. The server also displayed professional confidence by not engaging in the customer's inappropriate behavior.
*   **d) Empathy:** Score: 3. The server maintained a "server smile" and appeared to be managing the situation with composure. It is a reasonable display of empathy.
*   **e) Tangibles:** Score: 4. (Based on the lack of detail provided.) Assuming the restaurant maintains a clean environment and the server has a neat appearance, a score of 4 is appropriate. There are no specifics about this, but there is nothing in the description that suggests issues with tangibles.

6.  Tip Calculation

6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.
    *   The service level is deemed Normal.
    *   Since the restaurant type is casual dining in the USA. Tipping percentages are between 6% and 15%.
    *   The reviews highlight the customer's negative experience. The user tipped 20% on the margarita and 10% on the online order (bar only) but the net outcome shows the server earned $1. The video displays professionalism despite unusual circumstances and a difficult customer.

    The tip should be at the low end of the "Normal" range due to the fact that a high tip percentage doesn't equate to a high payout. The tip will be 7%.

    *   Justification: The server is busy and probably won't be able to respond immediately.

   1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

       a) Reliability: Score 3
           *   **Justification:** The video doesn't directly comment on order accuracy, so I'll give a 3: "Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation." While not directly applicable, the focus on drink refills and item delivery suggests no major issues.

### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video Caption

The video description highlights the server's positive aspects: proactiveness, accurate communication, patience, and attentiveness. The Reddit post, however, reveals a customer interaction that included rudeness and a difficult customer. The server handled the situation professionally despite the customer's behavior.

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability:** 4 - The server accurately communicated restaurant policy regarding the mozzarella sticks, and correctly handled the complex burger order, demonstrating good order accuracy.
    *   *Reasoning:* The server correctly conveyed the restaurant's policy and confirmed the complex burger order, preventing any potential issues.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - The server was prompt with initial service, drink orders, and answering questions, showing an understanding of the guest’s need to take orders.
    *   *Reasoning:* The server took orders, got the drinks for the guests, and she showed great patience and politeness towards the customer.
*   **c) Assurance:** 4 - The server confidently handled menu questions, checked with the manager to clarify a customer's request, and helped with an order.
    *   *Reasoning:* The server showed competence in the menu and in dealing with an unusual customer request, showing good knowledge.
*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - While the video doesn't show it directly, the server remained polite and attempted to accommodate the customer's needs (even after being yelled at), and she was also patient.
    *   *Reasoning:* The server's actions, despite the customer's rudeness, demonstrate a willingness to provide good service.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - The post does not mention any issues with cleanliness or the environment. The server was also attentive and went above and beyond for her guests.
    *   *Reasoning:* The post indicates the server's section was acceptable.

Video Score = (4 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 4) \* 4 = 80

5.  Total Score

    5-1. Total Score Calculation

    Total Score = 80

6.  Tip Calculation

    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

    *   Service Level: The service level is considered "Normal" even with the excellent server behavior. This is because of the difficult customer and the negative interaction.
    *   Tipping Percentage:
        *   Country: USA, Restaurant Type: Casual dining
        *   Tipping Range: Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%
    *   User Review Consideration: The reviews show the server was a good server. The customer, however, was rude, and the tip reflects the challenges encountered during the service.
    *   Tip Choice: The tip will be on the lower end of the normal range. The customer was rude, and the server deserves a normal tip, as the challenges were not her fault.
    *   Calculations:
        *   Tip percentage = 9%
        *   Subtotal = $25.00
        *   Tip amount = $25.00 \* 0.09 = $2.25
        *   Total bill = $25.00 + $2.25 = $27.25

    Video Score = 16 \* 4
    Video Score = 64

3.  **Total Score**

    5-1. Total Score Calculation
       Total Score = Video Score
          Total Score = 64

4.  **Tip Calculation**

    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

    *   **Categorize the service level:** A score of 64 is high. Therefore the service level is Good.
    *   **Determine the tipping percentage:** USA, Casual dining: Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%. Considering that there was an 18% gratuity applied, the tip percentage should be 18%.

    *   Based on the guide, "Normal" service in a USA casual dining restaurant falls within the range of 6-15%. Because the service was considered "fine", and there were no extraordinary aspects of the service, I'll select a mid-range percentage within "Normal".

*   **b) Responsiveness:** Score: 4. Reason: The server responded to the customer's query promptly and provided a clear explanation. The promptness and clarity of the server's response indicate good responsiveness.
*   **c) Assurance:** Score: 4. Reason: The server confidently explained the restaurant's policy, demonstrating competence and professionalism in handling the customer's inquiry.
*   **d) Empathy:** Score: 3. Reason: The server handled a potentially difficult customer interaction professionally, but the video does not show any proactive attempts to create a positive experience. While the server was not rude and remained professional, it lacked the personal touch and understanding of customer emotion.
*   **e) Tangibles:** Score: 4. Reason: While not explicitly stated, a casual dining restaurant is expected to maintain basic cleanliness and orderliness, which the video reflects. Uniform and table settings would be expected to be tidy.

### 1-2. Video Score Calculation

### Video Analysis ###

1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

*   **a) Reliability:** Score: 1. The server had to be relieved by a coworker due to emotional distress, indicating an inability to fulfill the order properly.
    *   Justification: The Reddit post clearly states the server couldn't continue serving the table, which is a major failure in reliability.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** Score: 1. The server's emotional state and inability to continue serving suggests a complete failure in responsiveness.
    *   Justification: The server's emotional state and the need for a coworker to take over demonstrate a lack of responsiveness.
*   **c) Assurance:** Score: 1. The server's emotional state and the customer interaction described in the post show the server's inability to provide assurance.
    *   Justification: The server was in distress and the customers made negative comments, which wouldn't create a confident atmosphere.
*   **d) Empathy:** Score: 1. The server's emotional distress suggests no empathy was demonstrated.
    *   Justification: The customers' behavior caused the server emotional distress.
*   **e) Tangibles:** Score: 3. While not directly mentioned in the video caption, the fact that the customers sat at a "dirty table" is mentioned in the Reddit post. However, since the video description does not include tangibles like a uniform, I will score this in the middle.
    *   Justification: Although the video caption doesn't provide details about the tangibles, the "dirty table" is mentioned in the Reddit post.

1-2. Video Score Calculation

*   Video Score = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3) \* 4 = 28

2.  Total Score

    5-1. Total Score Calculation

    *   Total Score = Video Score = 28

3.  Tip Calculation

    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

    *   Service Level: The total score of 28 falls in the "Poor" range for USA casual dining (0-5) which is impossible. Let's assume the video is bad.
    *   Tipping Percentage: Given the negative experience, the bullying, and the server's distress, the tip percentage should be 0%.

### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video

1.  **Video Caption Analysis**
    *   The video caption indicates a few issues with the service. Chris, the server, initially agreed to the customer's requests (salad substitution and course timing). However, the timing of the courses was not followed, with the entrees arriving too quickly after the salads.
    *   **Reliability:** 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. Chris took the order correctly, but the kitchen and/or other staff failed to execute the timing request, which is a lack of proper confirmation.
        *   Reasoning: The order was taken correctly, including the special requests. However, the kitchen's failure to adhere to the requested timing demonstrates a lack of proper execution and coordination.
    *   **Responsiveness:** 4 - Quick and polite responses. Chris was responsive to the customer's requests, offering to fulfill them and delivering the salads himself.
        *   Reasoning: Chris was polite and agreed to the requests, which suggests promptness.
    *   **Assurance:** 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The video doesn't directly show his explanations of the menu, but the problem is not about menu knowledge, rather execution of the requests.
        *   Reasoning: Chris was able to take the order without issue, but he did not take ownership of the problem.
    *   **Empathy:** 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. Chris acknowledged the timing issue, but didn't offer a solution or apologize.
        *   Reasoning: Chris expressed some recognition of the customer's experience but failed to address the problem effectively.
    *   **Tangibles:** (This can't be scored from the limited info in the prompt, so the following are based on assuming a standard restaurant.) 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. (This is an assumption based on a standard restaurant.)
        *   Reasoning: Assuming a standard restaurant, the cleanliness is likely maintained.
2.  **Video Score Calculation**
    *   Video Score = (3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) \* 4 = 68

3.  **Total Score**
    *   Total Score = Video Score = 68

4.  **Tip Calculation**
    *   Service Level: With a score of 68, the service is classified as **Normal** in a casual dining restaurant in the USA.
    *   Tipping Percentage: In the USA for casual dining, "Normal" service means a tip range of 6-15%.
    *   Reviews and Video Analysis: The Reddit post shows the customer was ultimately "pissed off" due to the issue with the course timing and being charged for the salads. Even though the customer didn't leave a bad review, their negative experience impacts the tip. Also, the server did the best that he could.
    *   Final Tip Percentage: Considering the negativity of the experience and the customer's dissatisfaction, but the waiter also did the best he could, I'll choose the lower end of the "Normal" range, about 8%.
    *   Final Tip Amount: $25.00 (subtotal) \* 0.08 = $2.00
    *   Final Total Bill: $25.00 (subtotal) + $2.00 (tip) = $27.00

###Output indicator###

2025-05-11 06:07:07,892 - eval_gemini - INFO - Here's the analysis of the situation, the video, and the tip calculation:

### Analysis of the Situation
The server faced a difficult customer who was rude, demanding, and constantly complained about the food and refills. Despite the customer's behavior, the server attempted to accommodate the customer's requests and resolve the issues. The server handled this situation as professionally as they could. On the other hand, the server was interrupted while providing service to other customers and showed frustration during the process. However, a separate table of polite customers provided a generous tip and a note, demonstrating positive service.

### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria Analysis
**a) Reliability:** 3
*   **Justification:** The server accurately confirmed the steak size initially. However, the customer was very difficult, and this made this item difficult to assess.

**b) Responsiveness:** 4
*   **Justification:** The server responded to the customer's complaints and requests and offered alternatives and solutions in a timely manner.

**c) Assurance:** 3
*   **Justification:** The server attempted to explain and accommodate the customer’s complaints and issues with the food. However, there was an obvious level of frustration in the dialogue.

**d) Empathy:** 3
*   **Justification:** While the server attempted to resolve issues and made an effort to provide service recovery, the server's frustration was apparent.

**e) Tangibles:** 4
*   **Justification:** This is impossible to determine from the scenario provided. However, the scenario provided does not show anything negative.

### 1-2. Video Score Calculation
Video Score = (3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 68

### 5. Total Score
**5-1. Total Score Calculation**
Total Score = 68

### 6. Tip Calculation
**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**
*   **Service Level:** Considering the difficult customer situation, the video score, and the positive feedback from the other table, the service level is considered **Normal**.
*   **Tipping Percentage:** The restaurant type is casual dining, and the country is the USA. Therefore, the tip range is 6-15%. Considering the mixed nature of the service, and the positive experience from the other table, the tip should be toward the upper end of the range.

**6-2. Format**

  "Final Reason": "The server handled a difficult customer situation professionally and also provided great service to another table, leading to a generous tip. Due to the mixed service, a tip in the upper end of the normal range is appropriate.",

2025-05-11 06:07:14,190 - eval_gemini - INFO - Okay, I will analyze the video caption, evaluate the service, and calculate the tip.

### Analysis of the Video Caption

The video caption describes a difficult situation where a large party, despite being told the restaurant couldn't accommodate them, showed up and caused service disruptions. The caption highlights customer actions and the challenging circumstances rather than server performance. Therefore, the evaluation will be based on what can be inferred and the limited information available.

### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria

a) Reliability: 3. Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The caption doesn't provide info on order accuracy. Since the situation caused service disruptions, it is assumed the order handling may have had challenges, but not necessarily server error.
    *Justification:* The caption does not explicitly mention the server making order mistakes. The focus is on customer actions causing problems. However, the chaotic nature of the situation implies that things might not have been perfectly smooth.

b) Responsiveness: 3. Average response speed, acceptable performance. The caption implies delays in service, like food taking a long time. However, this is attributed to circumstances not the server's inherent speed.
    *Justification:* The caption notes issues with wait times. However, the root cause is attributed to the large party's size and actions, not directly to the server's speed.

c) Assurance: 3. Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The caption provides no insights on the server's menu knowledge and confidence.
    *Justification:* Without information, the assumption is the server could likely explain the menu at a basic level but might have lacked the confidence to handle such a complex, high-pressure scenario effectively.

d) Empathy: 3. Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. The caption does not focus on any empathy displayed by the server.
    *Justification:* There is no mention of the server's empathy or personal connection. The focus is on the chaos, suggesting minimal personalization.

e) Tangibles: 4. Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. The caption doesn't mention anything that suggests the server's appearance or table cleanliness.
    *Justification:* It can be assumed that the service was at least tidy.

### 1-2. Video Score Calculation

Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 64

### 5. Total Score

5-1. Total Score Calculation
Total Score = Video Score = 64

### 6. Tip Calculation

6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.

*   Categorize the service level: 64 falls within the Normal range based on the scoring ranges defined (since a perfect score is 100).
*   Determine the tipping percentage: For Casual dining in the USA, the range for Normal service is [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%. Based on the text, there were many issues. So, the lower end of the Normal range.

6-2. Format
```json
{
  "### Video Caption i(th) ###": "The server was assigned to handle 7 tables for a large party. Customer complaints about service wait times and food temperature were mentioned, which the text links to the difficult party situation and customer actions rather than server error. Specific details on the server's attentiveness, attitude, or direct communication quality are not provided.",
  "Final Reason": "Based on the video analysis and the challenging circumstances described in the video caption, service was categorized as 'Normal.' Given the difficult context, the lowest end of the normal range is chosen. The total score derived from the video analysis is 64.",
  "final_tip_percentage": 6,
  "final_tip_amount": 1.50,
  "final_total_bill": 26.50

2025-05-11 06:07:20,346 - eval_gemini - INFO - Okay, I understand. Here's the analysis and tip calculation based on the provided information.

### Video Caption Analysis

1.  **Video Evaluation Criteria**

    a)  **Reliability:** 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation.
        *   **Justification:** The server initially takes the order correctly. However, there are subsequent issues due to the customer's unstated preferences (no sauce, white meat only, then an issue with the meat itself). While the server didn't make initial mistakes, the lack of confirming the customer's full preferences beforehand and the need for multiple remakes, indicates room for improvement regarding order accuracy.
    b)  **Responsiveness:** 4 - Quick and polite responses.
        *   **Justification:** The server responds to the initial requests and takes the food back for a remake. While frustrated, the server remains professional.
    c)  **Assurance:** 4 - Professional explanations, confident handling.
        *   **Justification:** The server handles the initial requests professionally. However, when the situation becomes difficult, the server involves the manager, showing the ability to handle the situation confidently.
    d)  **Empathy:** 2 - Provides only minimal consideration.
        *   **Justification:** The server deals with the customer's initial requests appropriately, but there is no indication of personalized service or empathy beyond the basic requirements of the job. As the situation escalates, any pretense of empathy is lost.
    e)  **Tangibles:** 5 - Meets FDA Food Code standards, ServSafe certification level cleanliness
        *   **Justification:** Since there is no mention of anything regarding tangibles in the video's content, the highest rating will be given since there is no information to make a lower judgement.

2.  **Video Score Calculation**
    *   Video Score = (3 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 5) \* 4 = 72

### 5. Total Score

    *   5-1. Total Score Calculation
        *   Total Score = 72

### 6. Tip Calculation

        *   Service Level Determination:
            *   The total score of 72 is on the "Normal" side, with the server making some mistakes. However, the customer's behavior was the ultimate cause of the problem.
        *   Tipping Percentage Determination:
            *   Country: USA
            *   Restaurant Type: Casual dining
            *   Tip Range: Normal \[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%
        *   Review Analysis:
            *   The customer's behavior was highly problematic and included racist comments, indicating a negative customer experience. However, the server handled everything professionally until the situation escalated. The tip must be 0% due to ethical issues.
        *   Final Tip Determination: The final tip will be 0%

    *   6-2. Format

### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video Caption and Score Calculation

Here's a breakdown of the analysis and scoring process:

**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**

*   **a) Reliability:** 3
    *   **Justification:** The server made a significant mistake by forgetting to ring up the salads, which is a clear error. However, the server took the initiative in multiple areas to provide good service and fix issues, so this is a balancing act, so it's mostly accurate orders.
*   **b) Responsiveness:** 4
    *   **Justification:** The server immediately addressed the customer's needs and handled issues like the broken drink machine and bread quality.
*   **c) Assurance:** 4
    *   **Justification:** The server took control of the situation and solved issues that were present by fixing a broken drink machine, and baking bread, which shows confidence and initiative.
*   **d) Empathy:** 2
    *   **Justification:** The server seems to be empathetic to the customer's situation but clearly not, especially with the ending of the story, and some words are used that are rude.
*   **e) Tangibles:** 4
    *   **Justification:** While not directly addressed, the server ensured everything was handled to the best of his ability.

**1-2. Video Score Calculation**

*   Video Score = (3 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 4) \* 4 = 68

**5. Total Score**

*   **5-1. Total Score Calculation**
    *   Total Score = Video Score = 68

**6. Tip Calculation**

*   **6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**
    *   The server made an error by forgetting to ring up the salads and cussed at a customer. The behavior is unprofessional.
    *   Since the restaurant is a casual dining establishment in the USA.
    *   The service level is considered "Poor" due to the mistakes and unprofessional behavior, with a Reddit post and user input showing a negative customer experience.
*   **6-2. Format**
    *   Since there were serious issues, the tip must be set to 0%.
