#### Video Caption
The server attended to other tables during their shift by bringing drinks and clearing a table. An item was subsequently found to be missing from the server's area. The server investigated the missing item by questioning a guest and using a locating device, ultimately confronting the individual who was found to possess the item.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### a) Reliability
**Score: 2**
- **Reason:** The server made a mistake by not keeping track of their items properly, leading to a missing item. However, they did handle the situation by investigating and resolving it.

#### b) Responsiveness
**Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The server was attentive to other tables, which is good, but the incident with the missing item suggests that their response to unexpected situations could be improved.

#### c) Assurance
**Score: 2**
- **Reason:** The server's investigation and confrontation of the guest might have been necessary, but it could have been handled more diplomatically and professionally.

#### d) Empathy
**Score: 2**
- **Reason:** The server's focus on the missing item and the confrontation with the guest show a lack of empathy and consideration for the customer's experience.

#### e) Tangibles
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** There is no mention of the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform, so we assume it was maintained at an acceptable level.

### Video Score Calculation

- **Total Score: 52**
- **Service Level: Normal**

Given the incident with the missing item and the way it was handled, we will choose a lower end of the normal range to reflect the need for improvement in professionalism and customer service.

**Chosen Tipping Percentage: 15%**

#### Final Tip Calculation
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Percentage: 15%**

The server reflected on these specific failures in service execution for this table.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

**a) Reliability:**
- **Score: 2**
- **Reason:** There were significant delays and a forgotten item (ranch), which indicates minor omissions but not major mistakes.

**b) Responsiveness:**
- **Score: 2**
- **Reason:** The server was delayed in delivering drinks and got held up at another table, indicating significant delays in response.

**c) Assurance:**
- **Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The server could explain the issues and reflect on them, showing some confidence but lacking the ability to handle the situation more proactively.

**d) Empathy:**

- **Reason:** The server showed minimal consideration by acknowledging the issues but did not go beyond that to personalize the service or show deeper understanding of the customer's frustration.

**e) Tangibles:**
- **Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The table and utensils were likely acceptable but lacked attention to detail, given the other issues mentioned.

#### Video Score Calculation

### Total Score Calculation

**Final Tip Percentage:**
- **16%** (Chosen as a midpoint within the Normal range to balance the positive reflection with the service issues)

**Tip Amount Calculation:**
\[ \text{Tip Amount} = 0.16 \times 25.00 = 4.00 \]

2025-05-11 23:58:11,597 - eval_qwen - INFO - ### Video Caption Analysis

#### Video Caption
Servers were assigned to a large group (52 people) that disregarded seating requests, spreading across multiple tables and sections. They struggled with complex check splitting and spent significant time ringing in orders due to the group's methods. Food delivery was severely delayed, taking over an hour and a half after serving began for all meals to arrive, and servers explained kitchen processes regarding order timing when the group complained. The servers were observed 'scrambling' due to the logistical challenges created by the group's behavior.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### a) Reliability
**Score: 2**
- **Reason**: The servers made no major mistakes, but they faced significant logistical challenges due to the large group's behavior. There were delays in food delivery, which indicates some issues in handling the orders efficiently.

#### b) Responsiveness
**Score: 2**
- **Reason**: The servers responded to the group's complaints about the delays, but their overall response speed was significantly affected by the complexity of the situation. They spent a lot of time dealing with check splitting and ringing in orders, leading to delays.

#### c) Assurance
**Score: 3**
- **Reason**: The servers attempted to explain the kitchen processes and order timing, which shows they tried to provide some assurance. However, their explanations lacked the confidence and professionalism needed to fully address the group's concerns.

#### d) Empathy
**Score: 3**
- **Reason**: The servers showed basic friendliness and tried to explain the delays, but the overall experience was not personalized. They were more focused on managing the logistical challenges rather than understanding and addressing individual customer emotions.

#### e) Tangibles
**Score: 4**
- **Reason**: Despite the chaotic environment, the servers managed to maintain a tidy and clean appearance. The table settings and uniform were likely kept in good condition, even though the overall service was affected by the group's behavior.

### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4) \times 4 = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

### Total Score Calculation
\[ \text{Total Score} = 56 \]

### Tip Calculation

#### Service Level Categorization
- **Total Score: 56**
- **Service Level: Normal**

#### Tipping Percentage Range
- **USA, Casual Dining, Normal: 6% to 15%**

#### Determining the Final Tipping Percentage
- **Review Content and Video Analysis**: The servers faced significant challenges due to the large group's behavior, which led to delays and inefficiencies. However, they did their best to manage the situation and provided some explanations. Given these factors, a mid-range tip is appropriate.

- **Chosen Tipping Percentage**: 10%

#### Tip Calculation
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Amount: \( 25.00 \times 0.10 = 2.50 \)**
- **Total Bill: \( 25.00 + 2.50 = 27.50 \)**

#### Video Caption
The server was overwhelmed while managing a large party that unexpectedly grew to 30 people and several other tables. This resulted in the server struggling to provide timely refills and attend to guest requests for the large party. Food delivery for the large party was not consistently in the order sent, leading to apparent guest dissatisfaction and delays. Other tables in the server's section were neglected due to the demands of the large group, despite manager assistance being sought to run food.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### Video Caption
The service included clearing a heavily laden table, offering alternative seating, and demonstrating wine knowledge. The server performed a quality check and addressed a customer complaint about food quality by explaining preparation methods, offering alternatives to guests, and removing the disputed items from the bill as service recovery. Order accuracy and timing of main courses are not explicitly detailed. The server deliberately announced the customer's multiple card declines during payment.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The server addressed a customer complaint and removed the disputed items from the bill, showing good service recovery. However, the order accuracy and timing of main courses are not explicitly detailed, which could indicate occasional lack of confirmation.

2. **Responsiveness**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason:** The server quickly and politely responded to the customer's complaint, offered alternatives, and removed the disputed items from the bill. This shows a quick and professional response to customer needs.

3. **Assurance**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason:** The server demonstrated wine knowledge and explained preparation methods, showing confidence and professionalism. However, the deliberate announcement of the customer's multiple card declines is a significant negative point.

4. **Empathy**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The server showed basic friendliness by addressing the customer's complaint and offering alternatives. However, the deliberate announcement of the customer's card declines shows a lack of empathy and respect for the customer's privacy.

5. **Tangibles**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason:** The server cleared a heavily laden table and offered alternative seating, indicating that the table settings were tidy and clean. However, the specific details of the uniform and overall cleanliness are not mentioned.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4) \times 4 = 18 \times 4 = 72 \]

#### Total Score
\[ \text{Total Score} = 72 \]

### Tip Calculation

1. **Service Level Categorization**
   - **Total Score: 72**
   - **Service Level: Good**

2. **Tipping Percentage Determination**
   - **Country: USA**
   - **Type: Casual dining**
   - **Service Level: Good**
   - **Tipping Range: 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%**
   - **Final Tipping Percentage: 18%** (chosen based on the positive aspects of the service, despite the ethical issue)

3. **Ethical Issue Consideration**
   - **Deliberate Announcement of Card Declines:** This is a significant ethical issue that negatively impacts the customer experience. However, since the user reviews take precedence and no other ethical issues are mentioned, we will consider this in the final tip calculation.

4. **Final Tip Calculation**
   - **Subtotal: $25.00**
   - **Tip Percentage: 18%**
   - **Tip Amount: \( 25.00 \times 0.18 = 4.50 \)**

#### Video Caption
"The server performs pre-bussing and refills drinks. The server subjectively feels they perform these tasks well and sometimes provide exceptional service."

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason:** The server is described as performing tasks well, which suggests that orders are likely handled accurately. However, the subjective nature of the statement and the lack of explicit confirmation procedures prevent a perfect score.

2. **Responsiveness**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason:** The server is described as performing tasks well and sometimes providing exceptional service, indicating quick and polite responses to customer needs.

3. **Assurance**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason:** The server's ability to perform tasks well and sometimes provide exceptional service suggests professional explanations and confident handling of customer queries.

4. **Empathy**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** While the server performs tasks well, the lack of specific mention of personalized service or remembering customer preferences limits the score to a basic level of friendliness.

5. **Tangibles**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason:** The server's performance of pre-bussing and refilling drinks indicates that the table and surroundings are kept tidy and clean.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4) \times 4 = 19 \times 4 = 76 \]

#### Total Score
\[ \text{Total Score} = 76 \]

### Tip Calculation

#### Service Level Categorization
- **Total Score: 76**
- **Service Level: Good** (since the score falls within the range for good service)

#### Tipping Percentage
- **Country: USA**
- **Restaurant Type: Casual dining**
- **Tipping Range for Good Service: 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%**

Given the positive nature of the video caption and the high total score, we will choose the upper end of the range to reflect the exceptional service mentioned.

- **Chosen Tipping Percentage: 20%**

#### Tip Amount Calculation
\[ \text{Tip Amount} = 20\% \times \$25.00 = 0.20 \times 25.00 = \$5.00 \]

#### Final Total Bill
\[ \text{Final Total Bill} = \$25.00 + \$5.00 = \$30.00 \]

### Final Output

The server delivered the food to the private room at the specified time according to the contract. When the late-arriving party complained, the server quickly returned the stored, still-hot food to the room.

#### Video Caption Analysis
**Video Caption:** During a busy shift, the server delivered drinks to a large party, experiencing perceived delays that were criticized by management. Following drink delivery, one table requested additional time with the menu. The server focused on treating customers as important, resulting in receipt of a 'very generous' [REMOVED] from one table.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score:** 3
   - **Reason:** The server experienced perceived delays, which suggests occasional lack of confirmation and potential minor omissions. However, the overall focus on treating customers as important indicates that most orders were handled accurately.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score:** 3
   - **Reason:** The server had perceived delays, which could indicate average response speed. However, the server managed to handle a large party and still treated customers as important, suggesting acceptable performance.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score:** 4
   - **Reason:** The server was able to handle a large party and manage customer requests, indicating professional explanations and confident handling. The criticism from management suggests room for improvement, but the overall performance was good.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score:** 4
   - **Reason:** The server focused on treating customers as important, which shows a high level of empathy. The receipt of a 'very generous' [REMOVED] from one table further supports this.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score:** 4
   - **Reason:** The video does not provide specific details about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. However, given the overall positive feedback and the server's focus on customer importance, it is reasonable to assume that the tangibles were maintained at a good level.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4) \times 4 = 18 \times 4 = 72 \]

#### Total Score Calculation
\[ \text{Total Score} = 72 \]

#### Tip Calculation

1. **Service Level Categorization:**
   - **Total Score:** 72
   - **Service Level:** Good (since 72 falls into the Good category for the USA casual dining)

2. **Tipping Percentage:**
   - **USA Casual Dining:**
     - Good: 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%
   - **Final Tipping Percentage:** 18% (chosen based on the positive feedback and overall good performance)

3. **Tip Amount Calculation:**
   - **Subtotal:** $25.00
   - **Tip Percentage:** 18%
   - **Tip Amount:** \( 25.00 \times 0.18 = 4.50 \)
   - **Total Bill:** \( 25.00 + 4.50 = 29.50 \)

2025-05-12 00:01:17,696 - eval_qwen - INFO - ### Video Analysis and Scoring

#### 1. Video Caption Analysis
The server worked during a busy dinner rush, took orders, and delivered the food. Upon noticing a birthday indication, the server arranged for a comped dessert, added candles, and lit them. The text does not provide further details on attentiveness, timing, or order accuracy beyond food delivery.

#### 2. Video Evaluation Criteria

##### a) Reliability
**Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The server took orders and delivered the food accurately, but there is no mention of confirming orders or handling custom requests. The lack of detailed information suggests that while the service was mostly accurate, there might have been occasional lack of confirmation.

##### b) Responsiveness
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server was quick to notice the birthday indication and arranged for a comped dessert, which shows a good level of responsiveness. However, there is no mention of how quickly they responded to other customer requests during the busy rush.

##### c) Assurance
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server arranged for a comped dessert and showed confidence in handling the situation. However, there is no information about their ability to explain the menu or handle other customer inquiries.

##### d) Empathy
**Score: 5**
- **Reason:** The server proactively understood the customer's emotional needs by arranging a comped dessert for a birthday celebration, which is a highly empathetic gesture.

##### e) Tangibles
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** There is no mention of the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. However, since the server arranged for a comped dessert, it suggests that the overall environment was likely maintained to a good standard.

#### 3. Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 4) \times 4 = 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

#### 4. Total Score
\[ \text{Total Score} = 80 \]

#### 5. Tip Calculation

##### a) Service Level Categorization
- **Service Level:** Good
- **Reason:** The total score of 80 falls into the Good category for casual dining in the USA, which ranges from 16 to 20.

##### b) Tipping Percentage Determination
- **Country:** USA
- **Restaurant Type:** Casual dining
- **Tipping Range for Good Service:** 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%
- **Final Tipping Percentage:** 18%
- **Reason:** Given the server's proactive and empathetic behavior, especially in arranging a comped dessert for a birthday celebration, the tip should be towards the higher end of the Good range.

##### c) Tip Amount Calculation
- **Subtotal:** $25.00
- **Tip Percentage:** 18%
- **Tip Amount:** \( 25.00 \times 0.18 = 4.50 \)
- **Total Bill:** \( 25.00 + 4.50 = 29.50 \)

2025-05-12 00:01:33,617 - eval_qwen - INFO - ### Video Caption Analysis

**Video Caption:**
During a busy rush, the server covered a table and responded to every customer request. The server maintained a professional and friendly demeanor.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### a) Reliability:
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server handled custom orders correctly and considered customer preferences, which is evident from the professional and friendly demeanor during a busy rush. However, since the caption does not explicitly mention repeat confirmation procedures, a score of 4 is appropriate.

#### b) Responsiveness:
**Score: 5**
- **Reason:** The server responded to every customer request immediately and maintained a friendly tone and facial expressions, indicating proactive problem-solving even during a busy rush.

#### c) Assurance:
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server provided professional explanations and handled the table with confidence, as indicated by the professional and friendly demeanor. However, the caption does not mention offering premium suggestions like wine pairings, so a score of 4 is appropriate.

#### d) Empathy:
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server maintained a professional and friendly demeanor, suggesting that they were attentive to customer needs. However, the caption does not provide evidence of remembering customer preferences or offering personalized services, so a score of 4 is appropriate.

#### e) Tangibles:
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server maintained a professional and friendly demeanor, which suggests that the table settings and uniform were likely tidy and clean. However, the caption does not explicitly mention meeting FDA Food Code standards or having ServSafe certification, so a score of 4 is appropriate.

### Video Score Calculation

**Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4**
- **Reliability:** 4
- **Responsiveness:** 5
- **Assurance:** 4
- **Empathy:** 4
- **Tangibles:** 4

**Total = 4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21**

**Video Score = 21 * 4 = 84**

### Total Score Calculation

**Total Score = Video Score = 84**

### Tip Calculation

#### Service Level Categorization:
- **Total Score: 84**
- **Service Level: Good** (since 84 falls within the Good range for casual dining in the USA)

#### Tipping Percentage Range:
- **USA, Casual Dining, Good: 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%**

#### Determining the Final Tipping Percentage:
- **Reason:** The server performed exceptionally well, maintaining a professional and friendly demeanor even during a busy rush. Given the high responsiveness and overall good service, the tip should be at the higher end of the Good range.

**Final Tipping Percentage: 19%**

#### Calculating the Tip Amount:
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Amount = Subtotal * Final Tipping Percentage**
- **Tip Amount = $25.00 * 0.19 = $4.75**

#### Calculating the Total Bill:
- **Total Bill = Subtotal + Tip Amount**
- **Total Bill = $25.00 + $4.75 = $29.75**

### Final Output

```json

  "### Video Caption 1st ###": "During a busy rush, the server covered a table and responded to every customer request. The server maintained a professional and friendly demeanor.",

2025-05-12 00:01:50,423 - eval_qwen - INFO - ### Video Caption Analysis

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

**a) Reliability:**
- **Score: 2**
- **Reason:** The server managed a large table, but there was a significant delay (1-1.5 hours) due to the kitchen. While the server attempted to mitigate the impact, the delay indicates a lack of reliability in managing the order and customer expectations. There were no major mistakes, but the delay is a significant issue.

**b) Responsiveness:**
- **Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The server did attempt to address the long wait time, but the response was not immediate or proactive. The server's efforts were average, and the customer still expressed extreme dissatisfaction. This suggests that the server could have been more responsive and proactive in managing the situation.

**c) Assurance:**
- **Score: 2**
- **Reason:** The server did not provide sufficient explanations for the delay or offer any solutions to mitigate the customer's frustration. The lack of clear communication and assurance contributed to the customer's dissatisfaction.

**d) Empathy:**
- **Score: 2**
- **Reason:** The server did not show a high level of empathy towards the customer's frustration. The customer's extreme dissatisfaction indicates that the server could have done more to understand and address the customer's emotions.

**e) Tangibles:**
- **Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The video does not provide specific details about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. However, given the overall poor experience, it is assumed that the tangibles were acceptable but lacked attention to detail.

#### Video Score Calculation
- **Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4**
- **Video Score = (2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3) * 4 = 12 * 4 = 48**

#### Total Score
- **Total Score = Video Score = 48**

### Tip Calculation

**Service Level Categorization:**
- **Total Score: 48**
- **Category: Poor (0 - 59)**

**Tipping Range for USA, Casual Dining:**
- **Poor: 0% - 5%**
- **Normal: 6% - 15%**
- **Good: 16% - 20%**

**Determination of Tipping Percentage:**
- Given the significant delay and the customer's extreme dissatisfaction, the service falls into the Poor category. However, the server did attempt to mitigate the impact, which slightly improves the score. Therefore, we will choose a higher end of the Poor range to reflect the effort made by the server.

**Chosen Tipping Percentage: 5%**

**Tip Amount Calculation:**
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Percentage: 5%**
- **Tip Amount = Subtotal * Tip Percentage = $25.00 * 0.05 = $1.25**

**Total Bill Calculation:**
- **Total Bill = Subtotal + Tip Amount = $25.00 + $1.25 = $26.25**

### Final Output

#### Video Caption
The server checked on the table then delayed returning, later asking about another round instead of providing the check. The server initially disputed the customer's claim of asking for the check, but quickly retrieved it while maintaining a visibly strained demeanor. After processing payment, the server later confronted the customer outside, throwing the receipt and shouting insults in response to a note left on the [REMOVED] line.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server delayed returning to the table and initially disputed the customer's request for the check, indicating a lack of reliability in handling customer requests accurately and promptly.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server was slow in responding to the customer's request for the check and initially ignored the customer's needs, which is a significant delay in service.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score: 1**
   - **Reason:** The server was unable to handle the situation professionally, disputed the customer's request, and showed a visibly strained demeanor, indicating a lack of assurance and professionalism.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score: 1**
   - **Reason:** The server showed no interest in the customer's needs and even confronted the customer outside, shouting insults, which demonstrates a complete lack of empathy and respect.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The video does not provide specific details about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform, so we assume it was acceptable but lacked attention to detail.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3) \times 4 = 9 \times 4 = 36 \]

#### Total Score
\[ \text{Total Score} = 36 \]

### Tip Calculation

#### Service Level Categorization
- **Total Score: 36**
- **Service Level: Poor** (Scores 0-35)

#### Tipping Percentage
- **Country: USA**
- **Type: Casual dining**
- **Poor Service Range: 0-5%**

Given the extremely poor service, including the server's confrontational behavior and lack of professionalism, the tip should be at the lower end of the range.

#### Final Tip Calculation
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Percentage: 0%** (due to the server's unethical behavior)
- **Tip Amount: \( 25.00 \times 0.00 = 0.00 \)**
- **Total Bill: \( 25.00 + 0.00 = 25.00 \)**

The server frequently interacted with the customer, consistently exhibiting specific behaviors such as leaning forward, making direct eye contact, tilting her head, and talking in a distinctive voice. She also engaged in actions like pushing her chest together and playing with her hair during these interactions. The text does not provide details on her handling of service aspects like order accuracy, timing, or standard attentiveness to needs.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### b) Responsiveness
**Score: 3**

#### c) Assurance
**Score: 2**
- **Reason:** The server's behaviors (leaning forward, making direct eye contact, etc.) suggest she was trying to engage with the customer, but the video does not provide information about her ability to answer menu questions or handle customer inquiries confidently.

#### d) Empathy
**Score: 1**
- **Reason:** The server's behaviors (pushing her chest together, playing with her hair) are inappropriate and show a lack of professionalism. These actions do not demonstrate genuine empathy or interest in the customer's experience.

#### e) Tangibles
**Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The video does not provide specific details about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. Given the lack of information, we assume that the environment was acceptable but lacked attention to detail.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability**

#### Video Caption
The server frequently ran back and forth to refill unlimited soup and salad orders. The server also vigorously grated fresh cheese tableside for customers. The server perspired heavily during service due to the exertion.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

**a) Reliability**
- **Score: 4**
- **Reason**: The server is consistently refilling orders and providing fresh cheese, indicating that they are attentive to customer needs and ensuring that orders are handled correctly. However, the heavy perspiration suggests that the server might be under stress, which could potentially lead to occasional lapses in accuracy.

**b) Responsiveness**
- **Score: 5**
- **Reason**: The server is actively running back and forth to refill orders and grating cheese tableside, showing immediate and proactive responses to customer requests. The server's efforts to maintain high responsiveness are evident despite the physical exertion.

**c) Assurance**
- **Score: 4**
- **Reason**: The server is providing fresh cheese and refilling orders, which demonstrates a professional approach to service. However, the heavy perspiration might indicate a lack of confidence or comfort, which could slightly affect the overall assurance provided to customers.

**d) Empathy**
- **Score: 3**
- **Reason**: The server is making an effort to provide a good experience by refilling orders and grating cheese, but the physical exertion and perspiration suggest that the server might not be fully focused on personalizing the service or understanding customer emotions.

**e) Tangibles**
- **Score: 4**
- **Reason**: The server is maintaining a clean and tidy table by continuously refilling orders and grating cheese. However, the heavy perspiration might indicate that the server's uniform could be damp, which could slightly detract from the overall cleanliness and presentation.

#### Video Caption Analysis
The video caption indicates that the server acknowledged failing the customer due to being overwhelmed and "in the weeds." A specific service failure involved a 20-minute wait for the check. The server stated they did their best under difficult circumstances but did not provide other specific objective details about the service delivered during the meal.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score:** 2
   - **Reason:** The server acknowledged making mistakes and failing the customer, specifically mentioning a 20-minute wait for the check. This indicates significant delays and issues with order accuracy and confirmation.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score:** 2
   - **Reason:** The server was slow in responding to the customer's request for the check, which took 20 minutes. This is a significant delay and affects the overall dining experience negatively.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score:** 3
   - **Reason:** The server was able to acknowledge their mistakes and express that they did their best, but lacked detailed explanations and confidence in addressing the issues. This suggests a basic level of assurance but room for improvement.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score:** 3
   - **Reason:** The server showed some basic friendliness by acknowledging their mistakes and expressing effort, but did not provide personalized service or show a deep understanding of the customer's emotions.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score:** 3
   - **Reason:** The video does not provide specific details about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. Given the overall poor service, it is reasonable to assume that the tangibles were acceptable but lacked attention to detail.

#### Video Caption
The server's tasks included seating guests, keeping drinks filled, pre-bussing plates, taking and delivering drink orders, managing late arrivals near closing, handling complex separate checks, and performing extensive cleanup. The environment presented challenges such as rapidly changing large group sizes, fast drink consumption, unclear headcount, and difficult check splitting.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score: 3**

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The server signed one slip with a personalized note, showing a basic level of empathy. However, the defensive response to the customer's question about the card holding time suggests a lack of deeper understanding and personalization.

#### Video Caption Analysis
The video caption indicates that the server at Gold Spoon struggled significantly with attentiveness and responsiveness due to being overwhelmed. This resulted in unfilled drinks, delays in food delivery and bussing, and errors in both food delivery and payment processing. Despite these issues, the server apologized and attempted to correct the payment error, explaining the difficult circumstances.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score:** 2
   - **Reason:** The server made frequent order mistakes and had multiple billing errors, which are significant issues in the service industry. However, they did attempt to correct the payment error, showing some effort to resolve the issues.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score:** 2
   - **Reason:** The server was slow in responding to customer needs, leading to unfilled drinks and delays in food delivery and bussing. This indicates a lack of quick and efficient service.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score:** 3
   - **Reason:** The server was able to explain the difficult circumstances and apologize for the mistakes, showing some level of professionalism. However, their ability to handle the situation confidently was lacking.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score:** 3
   - **Reason:** The server showed basic friendliness by apologizing and attempting to explain the situation. However, there was a lack of personalization and proactive understanding of customer emotions.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score:** 3
   - **Reason:** The video does not provide specific details about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, and the server's uniform. However, given the overall poor service, it is reasonable to assume that the attention to detail in maintaining cleanliness was also lacking.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3) \times 4 = 13 \times 4 = 52 \]

#### Total Score Calculation
\[ \text{Total Score} = \text{Video Score} = 52 \]

#### Tip Calculation

1. **Service Level Categorization:**
   - **Total Score:** 52
   - **Service Level:** Normal (since the score falls between 6 and 52)

2. **Tipping Percentage Range:**
   - **Country:** USA
   - **Type:** Casual dining
   - **Range for Normal Service:** 6% to 15%

3. **Final Tipping Percentage:**
   - Given the multiple errors and delays, but considering the server's efforts to correct the mistakes and explain the situation, a middle-of-the-range tip is appropriate.
   - **Final Tipping Percentage:** 10%

4. **Tip Amount Calculation:**
   - **Subtotal:** $25.00
   - **Tip Percentage:** 10%
   - **Tip Amount:** \( 25.00 \times 0.10 = 2.50 \)
   - **Total Bill:** \( 25.00 + 2.50 = 27.50 \)

#### Video Caption
The server volunteered to take over a large table after an initial seating error involving another staff member. The server introduced themselves, acknowledged the prior mixup, and proceeded with service, starting with drink orders. The server used a sarcastic and joking communication style with the customers throughout the night. Service was completed for the large group without the table having any major problems or complaints.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### a) Reliability
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server handled custom orders correctly and considered customer preferences. There were no major mistakes, and the service was completed without any issues or complaints.

#### b) Responsiveness
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server responded quickly and politely to customer requests. They volunteered to take over the table and managed the service efficiently.

#### c) Assurance
**Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The server could explain the menu but lacked confidence at times. The sarcastic and joking communication style might not have been professional, but it did not deter the service quality.

#### d) Empathy
**Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The server showed basic friendliness but lacked personalization. They acknowledged the initial mixup and maintained a good rapport with the customers.

#### e) Tangibles
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The table and uniform were tidy, and cleanliness was maintained throughout the service.

### Video Score Calculation
**Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4**
**Video Score = (4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 18 * 4 = 72**

### Total Score
**Total Score = Video Score = 72**

- **Good Service: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20%**

#### Final Tipping Percentage
- **Reason:** The service was generally good, with quick and polite responses, and the server handled the table well despite the initial mixup. However, the sarcastic and joking communication style might not have been the most professional. Therefore, we will choose a slightly lower percentage within the "Good" range.
- **Final Tipping Percentage: 18%**

#### Tip Amount Calculation
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Amount = Subtotal * Final Tipping Percentage**

#### Video Caption
The server worked under extreme pressure with a high table ratio (13 tables per server) and limited staff during a peak period. Service experienced considerable delays, with food orders taking approximately 20 minutes and drink refills taking 5 minutes. The server was described as working intensely and attempting to manage the challenging situation while acknowledging service issues.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason**: There were significant delays in food orders and drink refills, which indicates that the service was not entirely reliable. However, the server acknowledged the issues and tried to manage them, which shows some effort to correct the situation.

2. **Responsiveness**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The server responded to customer requests but with noticeable delays. Given the high table ratio and limited staff, the response time was understandable but still below optimal standards.

3. **Assurance**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The server could explain the menu but lacked confidence due to the overwhelming workload. They acknowledged the service issues, which shows a level of professionalism, but their ability to handle the situation was limited.

4. **Empathy**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The server showed basic friendliness and attempted to address customer concerns, but the high pressure and delays affected their ability to provide personalized service.

5. **Tangibles**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason**: Despite the high pressure, the table settings and cleanliness were maintained at an acceptable level. The server ensured that the table and utensils were tidy, even though the overall service was delayed.

2. **Tipping Range for USA Casual Dining**
   - **Normal**: 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%

3. **Determination of Final Tip Percentage**
   - **Reason**: The service was generally acceptable but had significant delays. The server's efforts to manage the situation and maintain cleanliness are commendable, but the delays and lack of confidence in handling the high-pressure environment suggest a mid-range tip.
   - **Final Tip Percentage**: 10%

4. **Tip Amount Calculation**
   - **Subtotal**: $25.00
   - **Tip Percentage**: 10%

2025-05-12 00:08:11,317 - eval_qwen - INFO - ### Analysis Output

#### Video Caption Analysis
The server asked the customer about their reservation status and confronted them about taking a reserved table. Despite the issue, the server allowed the group to remain seated. The server refused the group's demand for food prioritization due to being alone in a busy restaurant and was likely unable to accommodate additional requests promptly.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server made a mistake by confronting the customers about taking a reserved table, which could have been handled more diplomatically. However, they did allow the group to remain seated, showing some flexibility.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server responded to the initial confrontation but was not very quick or polite in addressing the group's request for food prioritization. The refusal to prioritize food due to being busy indicates a delay in responsiveness.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server was unable to handle the situation smoothly, showing a lack of confidence in resolving the reservation issue. They also did not provide clear explanations for why food prioritization was not possible.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server showed minimal consideration for the customers' preferences and feelings. The confrontation and refusal to prioritize food indicate a lack of empathy.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The video does not provide specific details about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. However, since the server allowed the group to remain seated, we can assume that the tangibles were at least acceptable.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3) \times 4 = 13 \times 4 = 52 \]

#### Total Score Calculation
\[ \text{Total Score} = \text{Video Score} = 52 \]

#### Tip Calculation

1. **Service Level Categorization:**
   - **Total Score: 52**
   - **Service Level: Poor** (Scores 0-52 fall into the Poor category for casual dining in the USA)

2. **Tipping Percentage Range:**
   - **USA Casual Dining: Poor [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%**

3. **Final Tipping Percentage:**
   - **Reason:** Given the confrontational nature of the interaction and the server's inability to handle the situation well, the tip should be at the lower end of the range to reflect the poor service.
   - **Final Tip Percentage: 2%**

4. **Tip Amount Calculation:**
   - **Subtotal: $25.00**
   - **Tip Amount: \( 25.00 \times 0.02 = 0.50 \)**

5. **Total Bill Calculation:**
   - **Total Bill: \( 25.00 + 0.50 = 25.50 \)**

2025-05-12 00:08:27,008 - eval_qwen - INFO - ### Video Caption Analysis

#### Video Caption
The server took over tables from colleagues who held negative stereotypes about certain customers. The server states they took care of these customers "all the same" as others. The server attributes their consistent receipt of at least 20% [REMOVED] from these tables to the quality of service provided.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability**
   - **Score:** 4
   - **Reason:** The server mentions that they took care of the customers "all the same," indicating that they handled custom orders and preferences correctly. However, since the video does not explicitly show the handling of specific orders, we cannot assign a perfect score.

2. **Responsiveness**
   - **Score:** 4
   - **Reason:** The server's statement suggests that they were attentive and responsive to the needs of the customers, despite the initial negative stereotypes from colleagues. They were able to maintain a high level of service.

3. **Assurance**
   - **Score:** 4
   - **Reason:** The server demonstrates confidence in their ability to handle the customers well, which is reflected in their consistent receipt of good tips. They likely provided professional explanations and handled the menu questions effectively.

4. **Empathy**
   - **Score:** 3
   - **Reason:** While the server treated all customers equally, the video does not provide evidence of personalized service or understanding of customer emotions. The service was professional but lacked the extra touch of personalization.

5. **Tangibles**
   - **Score:** 4
   - **Reason:** The server's consistent receipt of good tips suggests that the overall dining experience, including the cleanliness and presentation, was satisfactory. However, without explicit visual confirmation, a perfect score is not warranted.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4) \times 4 = 19 \times 4 = 76 \]

### Total Score
\[ \text{Total Score} = 76 \]

### Tip Calculation

#### Service Level Categorization
- **Total Score:** 76
- **Service Level:** Good (since the score is above 60)

#### Tipping Percentage
- **Country:** USA
- **Type:** Casual dining
- **Service Level:** Good
- **Tipping Range:** 16% to 20%

Given the positive feedback and the consistent receipt of at least 20% tips, we will choose the higher end of the range.

#### Final Tip Calculation
- **Subtotal:** $25.00
- **Tip Percentage:** 20%
- **Tip Amount:** \( 25.00 \times 0.20 = 5.00 \)
- **Total Bill:** \( 25.00 + 5.00 = 30.00 \)

2025-05-12 00:10:10,371 - eval_qwen - INFO - ### Video Analysis

#### Video Caption
The server managed a party of 11 with a single check. The server hesitantly informed the customer about the automatic [REMOVED] policy and asked for permission to add it. The server overheard a customer complaint about needing to ask twice for a to-go cup and offered to remove a portion of the [REMOVED].

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The server managed a large party and handled the check correctly. However, the hesitation in informing the customer about the automatic [REMOVED] policy suggests a lack of confidence and possibly a lack of clear communication.

2. **Responsiveness**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason**: The server responded quickly to the customer's request for a to-go cup and even overheard the complaint, showing attentiveness. However, the need to ask twice indicates a slight delay in initial response.

3. **Assurance**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The server was able to explain the automatic [REMOVED] policy but did so hesitantly, indicating a lack of confidence. The offer to remove a portion of the [REMOVED] shows a willingness to address customer concerns.

4. **Empathy**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The server showed basic friendliness and attempted to resolve the issue with the to-go cup. However, the overall interaction lacked personalization and a deeper understanding of customer emotions.

5. **Tangibles**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason**: The table and uniform appeared to be clean and tidy, maintaining a good standard of cleanliness. There were no visible issues with the table setting or the server's appearance.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) \times 4 = 17 \times 4 = 68 \]

### Total Score Calculation
\[ \text{Total Score} = 68 \]

### Tip Calculation

#### Service Level Categorization
- **Total Score: 68**
- **Service Level: Good**

#### Tipping Percentage Range
- **Country: USA**
- **Type: Casual dining**
- **Good Service: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20%**

#### Final Tip Percentage Determination
- **Reason**: The server managed a large party well, showed attentiveness, and attempted to resolve issues. However, there were some hesitations and a lack of personalization. Given the overall positive performance, we will choose a middle value in the Good range.
- **Final Tip Percentage: 18%**

#### Tip Amount Calculation
\[ \text{Tip Amount} = 18\% \times \$25.00 = 0.18 \times 25.00 = \$4.50 \]

#### Total Bill Calculation
\[ \text{Total Bill} = \$25.00 + \$4.50 = \$29.50 \]

### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### a) Reliability

#### Video Caption
The server managed splitting a large bill for an eight-top and informed guests about discrepancies before billing. A billing error occurred concerning an appetizer charge.

2. **Responsiveness:**

   - **Reason:** The server showed empathy by engaging with the customer who returned and offering a personal refund. This indicates a personalized approach to customer service.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason:** The video does not provide specific details about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, and uniform. However, the overall professional demeanor suggests that the tangibles were likely well-maintained.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4) \times 4 = 24 \times 4 = 96 \]

#### Total Score Calculation
\[ \text{Total Score} = 96 \]

### Tip Calculation

   - **Type: Casual dining**
   - **Good Service Range: 16-20%**
   - **Final Tipping Percentage: 18%**
     - **Reason:** The service was generally good, with a few minor issues. The server's proactive problem-solving and personal refund offer warrant a higher tip within the Good range.

3. **Tip Amount Calculation:**
   - **Subtotal: $25.00**
   - **Tip Percentage: 18%**
   - **Tip Amount: \( 25.00 \times 0.18 = 4.50 \)**

4. **Total Bill Calculation:**

2025-05-12 00:13:44,699 - eval_qwen - INFO - ### Video Analysis and Scoring

#### Video Caption
The bartender had the takeout order ready upon arrival. He presented the check but then delayed processing the payment for approximately ten minutes, during which time he interacted with another customer and assisted a server with a different order. After being prompted and realizing the delay, he processed the payment and offered a brief apology.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The order was ready upon arrival, which is good. However, there was a delay in processing the payment, indicating occasional lack of confirmation and attention to the current task.

2. **Responsiveness**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason**: The bartender responded to the customer after a significant delay and only after being prompted. This shows a lack of immediate attention to the customer's needs.

3. **Assurance**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The bartender was able to handle the order and payment, but the delay suggests a lack of confidence and professionalism in managing multiple tasks simultaneously.

4. **Empathy**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason**: The bartender offered a brief apology, which is minimal consideration. There was no proactive understanding or attempt to make up for the delay.

5. **Tangibles**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason**: The takeout order was ready and presumably clean, and the interaction took place in a typical setting. There were no visible issues with cleanliness or uniform.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4) \times 4 = 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

#### Total Score
\[ \text{Total Score} = 56 \]

#### Tip Calculation

1. **Service Level Categorization**
   - **Total Score: 56**
   - **Category: Normal** (since 56 falls within the range of 6-14 for normal service)

2. **Tipping Percentage Range**
   - **Country: USA**
   - **Type: Casual dining**
   - **Normal Service: 6-15%**

3. **Review Content and Positivity/Negativity**
   - The video shows a significant delay in processing the payment, which is a negative aspect.
   - The bartender did apologize, which is a positive aspect.
   - Given the mixed nature of the interaction, we will choose a mid-range percentage.

4. **Final Tipping Percentage**
   - **Chosen Percentage: 10%**

5. **Tip Amount Calculation**
   - **Subtotal: $25.00**
   - **Tip Amount: \( 25.00 \times 0.10 = 2.50 \)**

6. **Total Bill Calculation**
   - **Total Bill: \( 25.00 + 2.50 = 27.50 \)**

2025-05-12 00:14:32,443 - eval_qwen - INFO - ### Video Caption Analysis

#### Video Caption
The server attended to a table for three hours, presenting the final bill at the end of their stay. The server reported running back and forth for the customer's requests. The customer verbally criticized the server during the interaction.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason**: The server had to run back and forth for customer requests, indicating that the service was not smooth and efficient. However, there were no major mistakes reported, so it falls into the category of minor omissions.

2. **Responsiveness**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The server responded to customer requests, but the fact that they had to run back and forth suggests that the response time was not quick or immediate. It was average and acceptable.

3. **Assurance**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The server was able to handle the requests, but the need to run back and forth indicates a lack of confidence or preparation. They could explain the menu, but not with the highest level of professionalism.

4. **Empathy**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason**: The customer verbally criticized the server, which suggests that the server did not provide a personalized or empathetic service. They provided only minimal consideration.

5. **Tangibles**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: There is no specific mention of the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. Given the context, it is assumed to be acceptable but lacking attention to detail.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3) \times 4 = 13 \times 4 = 52 \]

#### Total Score Calculation
\[ \text{Total Score} = 52 \]

### Tip Calculation

1. **Service Level Categorization**
   - **Total Score: 52**
   - **Service Level: Normal**
     - **Reason**: The score of 52 falls within the range of 6 to 15 for normal service in casual dining in the USA.

2. **Tipping Percentage Determination**
   - **Country: USA**
   - **Type: Casual Dining**
   - **Service Level: Normal**
   - **Tipping Range: 6% to 15%**
   - **Final Tipping Percentage: 10%**
     - **Reason**: Given the average performance and the fact that the customer verbally criticized the server, we choose the middle of the normal range to balance the service quality and customer feedback.

3. **Tip Amount Calculation**
   - **Subtotal: $25.00**
   - **Tip Percentage: 10%**
   - **Tip Amount: \( 25.00 \times 0.10 = 2.50 \)**
   - **Total Bill: \( 25.00 + 2.50 = 27.50 \)**

### Final Output

2025-05-12 00:15:04,677 - eval_qwen - INFO - ### Video Caption Analysis

**Video Caption:** The text states the service was excellent. However, no specific details are provided regarding server attentiveness, order accuracy, timing, attitude, or communication.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### a) Reliability:
**Score: 4**
**Reason:** The video caption indicates that the service was excellent, which suggests high reliability. However, since no specific details about order accuracy or confirmation procedures are provided, we cannot assume the highest score. Therefore, we assign a score of 4, indicating that custom orders were likely handled correctly and allergy/cooking preferences were considered.

#### b) Responsiveness:
**Score: 4**
**Reason:** The service is described as excellent, which implies quick and polite responses. However, without specific details about response times or proactivity, we assign a score of 4, indicating quick and polite responses but not immediate and proactive problem-solving.

#### c) Assurance:
**Score: 4**
**Reason:** The excellent service suggests professional explanations and confident handling. However, without specific details about menu knowledge or customer trust, we assign a score of 4, indicating professional explanations and confident handling but not the highest level of trust and premium suggestions.

#### d) Empathy:
**Score: 4**
**Reason:** The excellent service suggests a good level of empathy. However, without specific details about personalization or understanding customer emotions, we assign a score of 4, indicating that the waiter remembers customer preferences and offers personalized services but does not go above and beyond.

#### e) Tangibles:
**Score: 4**
**Reason:** The excellent service suggests a high standard of cleanliness and tidiness. However, without specific details about the table settings or uniform, we assign a score of 4, indicating that the uniform and table settings are tidy and cleanliness is maintained but not at the highest level of FDA Food Code standards.

### Video Score Calculation

**Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4**
**Video Score = (4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4) * 4 = 20 * 4 = 80**

### Total Score Calculation

**Total Score = Video Score = 80**

### Tip Calculation

#### Service Level Categorization:
- **Total Score: 80**
- **Service Level: Good**

#### Tipping Percentage Range:
- **USA, Casual Dining: Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%**

#### Final Tip Percentage:
- **Based on the positive but not overly detailed review, we choose the middle of the range: 18%**

#### Tip Amount Calculation:
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Percentage: 18%**
- **Tip Amount = Subtotal * Tip Percentage = $25.00 * 0.18 = $4.50**

#### Total Bill Calculation:
- **Total Bill = Subtotal + Tip Amount = $25.00 + $4.50 = $29.50**

### Final Output

```json
{
  "### Video Caption 1st ###": "The text states the service was excellent. However, no specific details are provided regarding server attentiveness, order accuracy, timing, attitude, or communication.",
  "Final Reason": "The service was described as excellent, but without specific details, we assigned moderate-high scores across all criteria. The total score of 80 falls into the 'Good' category for casual dining in the USA, leading to a tip percentage of 18%.",

#### Video Caption
The server addressed a complaint about a missing drink ordered via the host, stating prior unawareness and confirming no charge. The server enforced the outside food policy and correctly delivered an item for a customer who expressed surprise, offering a timely alternative which was declined. The server also dealt with customers grabbing them about a broken toilet issue.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### a) Reliability
**Score: 3**
**Reason:** The server correctly handled the missing drink and confirmed no charge, but there was a delay in awareness. The server also correctly delivered an item for a customer who expressed surprise, showing that most orders were accurate but with occasional lack of confirmation.

#### b) Responsiveness
**Score: 3**
**Reason:** The server responded to the missing drink and the broken toilet issue, but the response was not immediate. The server offered a timely alternative for the surprised customer, which shows average response speed and acceptable performance.

#### c) Assurance
**Score: 3**
**Reason:** The server explained the missing drink and the outside food policy, but lacked confidence in addressing the broken toilet issue, which was handled by the customers themselves.

#### d) Empathy
**Score: 3**
**Reason:** The server showed basic friendliness in addressing the missing drink and the broken toilet issue, but did not personalize the service or show deeper understanding of customer emotions.

#### e) Tangibles
**Score: 4**
**Reason:** The server maintained a tidy uniform and table settings, and there were no mentions of cleanliness issues in the video caption.

### Video Score Calculation
**Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4**
**Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 16 * 4 = 64**

### Total Score
**Total Score = Video Score = 64**

### Tip Calculation

#### Service Level Categorization
Based on the total score of 64, the service level is categorized as **Normal**.

#### Tipping Percentage
For the USA, in casual dining, the tipping range for normal service is **[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%**.

Given the video analysis, the server showed average performance with some positive aspects (correctly handling orders and maintaining cleanliness) and some areas for improvement (lack of immediate response and confidence in addressing issues). Therefore, a mid-range tip of **10%** is appropriate.

#### Final Tip Calculation
**Subtotal: $25.00**
**Tip Percentage: 10%**
**Tip Amount: $25.00 * 0.10 = $2.50**
**Total Bill: $25.00 + $2.50 = $27.50**

**Final Tipping Percentage: 19%**

#### Calculating the Tip Amount
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Amount = Subtotal * Final Tipping Percentage = $25.00 * 0.19 = $4.75**

#### Video Caption
The server managed a large party of 8-9 people in a busy restaurant environment with a slow kitchen. The server communicated unavailable drink options to the table. A side item for the nachos was not delivered to the table after the main meal was served. This omission occurred because the server became overwhelmed with tasks from multiple tables.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### a) Reliability
**Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The server managed to communicate unavailable drink options, which shows attention to detail. However, the side item for the nachos was not delivered, indicating a minor omission due to being overwhelmed with tasks.

#### b) Responsiveness
**Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The server was able to handle a large party in a busy environment, which is commendable. However, the delay in delivering the side item suggests that the response speed could have been better under the circumstances.

#### c) Assurance
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server effectively communicated unavailable drink options, showing a good understanding of the menu and the ability to handle customer queries professionally.

#### d) Empathy
**Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The server showed basic friendliness and managed a large group, but the omission of the side item and the overwhelmed state suggest a lack of personalization and proactive problem-solving.

#### e) Tangibles
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The table and uniform were likely maintained to a reasonable standard, given the busy environment. However, the missing side item indicates a slight lapse in attention to detail.

### Video Score Calculation

#### Final Tip Percentage
- **Reason:** The server performed well overall, managing a large party in a busy environment and communicating effectively. However, the minor omission of the side item slightly reduces the tip percentage from the highest range.

#### Video Caption Analysis
The video caption describes a scenario where customers at Outback Steakhouse attempted to pay with a gift card from a different restaurant. The server initially communicated the error in an awkward manner but managed to resolve the situation with laughter. The server also proactively inquired with management about potentially offering a discount, despite the error being on the customers' part. No further details about the server's general attentiveness or service delivery during the meal are provided.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The server accurately identified the error with the gift card and resolved it. However, the initial communication was awkward, indicating a lack of smoothness in handling the situation.

2. **Responsiveness**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason**: The server responded quickly to the customers' issue and proactively inquired about a potential discount, showing a willingness to go above and beyond to satisfy the customers.

3. **Assurance**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason**: The server handled the situation professionally and sought to ensure customer satisfaction by checking with management for a discount. This shows confidence and a commitment to resolving issues.

4. **Empathy**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The server managed to turn an awkward situation into a positive one with laughter, showing some level of empathy. However, the lack of additional details about personalized service suggests a moderate level of empathy.

5. **Tangibles**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The video caption does not provide specific details about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. Therefore, we assume an average level of cleanliness and tidiness.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3) \times 4 = 17 \times 4 = 68 \]

#### Total Score Calculation
\[ \text{Total Score} = 68 \]

#### Tip Calculation
1. **Service Level Categorization**
   - **Total Score: 68**
   - **Category: Good** (since 68 falls within the Good range for casual dining in the USA)

2. **Tipping Percentage Range for USA Casual Dining**
   - **Good: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20%**

3. **Final Tipping Percentage**
   - **Reason**: Given the server's proactive approach and professional handling of the gift card issue, which turned a potentially negative experience into a positive one, we will choose a higher end of the range.
   - **Final Tipping Percentage: 18%**

4. **Tip Amount Calculation**
   - **Subtotal: $25.00**
   - **Tip Amount: \( 25.00 \times 0.18 = 4.50 \)**

5. **Total Bill Calculation**
   - **Total Bill: \( 25.00 + 4.50 = 29.50 \)**

#### Video Caption
The server attended to a demanding table for 2.5 hours. The server comped the family's desserts and coffees and thanked them for coming in. The text provides limited specific details about the server's handling of complaints or their attentiveness during the service beyond mentioning the table was demanding.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The server comped the family's desserts and coffees, which suggests they were trying to address any issues. However, the caption does not provide specific details about order accuracy or handling custom requests, so we assume mostly accurate orders with occasional lack of confirmation.

2. **Responsiveness**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason:** The server attended to a demanding table for 2.5 hours, indicating they were attentive and responsive to the family's needs. They also comped the desserts and coffees, showing a proactive approach to problem-solving.

3. **Assurance**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The server comped the desserts and coffees, which shows they can handle issues, but the caption does not provide information on their ability to explain the menu or handle customer questions confidently.

4. **Empathy**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason:** The server thanked the family for coming in and comped their desserts and coffees, indicating they were trying to make the experience better for the demanding table. This shows a level of personalization and understanding of customer emotions.

5. **Tangibles**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason:** The caption does not provide specific details about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. However, given that the server comped the desserts and coffees, we can assume the overall environment was acceptable and maintained.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4) \times 4 = 18 \times 4 = 72 \]

#### Total Score
\[ \text{Total Score} = 72 \]

### Tip Calculation

1. **Service Level Categorization**
   - **Total Score: 72**
   - **Service Level: Good** (Scores 60-80 fall into the Good category)

2. **Tipping Percentage**
   - **Country: USA**
   - **Type: Casual dining**
   - **Good Service Range: 16-20%**
   - **Final Tip Percentage: 18%** (Middle of the range, as there is no extreme positivity or negativity in the reviews and video)

3. **Tip Amount Calculation**
   - **Subtotal: $25.00**

#### Video Caption
The server managed a challenging party of 25 people, successfully taking all drink and food orders and enforcing the restaurant's policy regarding checks for large groups. The server checked on drinks and responded promptly to a customer inquiry. The server ensured correct food delivery despite a dispute with a colleague that resulted in a public verbal confrontation.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason**: The server managed to handle a large group accurately, ensuring all drink and food orders were taken correctly. There were no mentions of order mistakes or billing errors. However, the dispute with a colleague might have caused a slight disruption, which is why it's not a perfect 5.

2. **Responsiveness**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason**: The server responded promptly to a customer inquiry and checked on drinks regularly. This indicates a quick and polite response, although the public verbal confrontation could have affected the overall experience slightly.

3. **Assurance**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason**: The server was able to enforce the restaurant's policy regarding checks for large groups, which shows professional handling and confidence. However, the dispute with a colleague might have undermined the assurance slightly.

4. **Empathy**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason**: The server managed a large group well, which suggests basic friendliness. However, the public verbal confrontation with a colleague indicates a lack of personalization and understanding of customer emotions.

5. **Tangibles**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reason**: The video does not mention any issues with cleanliness or uniform. The server maintained a tidy appearance and ensured the table settings were appropriate, but the public dispute might have affected the overall ambiance slightly.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4) \times 4 = 23 \times 4 = 92 \]

#### Total Score Calculation
\[ \text{Total Score} = 92 \]

### Tip Calculation

1. **Service Level Categorization**
   - **Total Score: 92**
   - **Service Level: Good** (since the score falls within the range of 16-20)

2. **Tipping Percentage Range for USA Casual Dining**
   - **Good: 16-20%**

3. **Final Tipping Percentage**
   - **Reason**: The server performed very well, managing a large group and ensuring accurate orders. However, the public verbal confrontation with a colleague is a significant negative point. Given the overall positive performance and the minor issue, a middle-to-upper range tip is appropriate.
   - **Final Tipping Percentage: 18%**

4. **Tip Amount Calculation**
   - **Subtotal: $25.00**
   - **Tip Amount: \( 25.00 \times 0.18 = 4.50 \)**

5. **Total Bill Calculation**
   - **Total Bill: \( 25.00 + 4.50 = 29.50 \)**

#### Video Caption
The server handled a large birthday party, catering to children's requests and assisting with decorations despite being busy making drinks. The server confirmed a coffee order twice, made it correctly, but when the customer changed their mind, partially corrected it by scooping out cream instead of remaking the drink during a lunch rush. The server also promptly retrieved a replacement sauce for a spilled item during the rush, only for the customer to decline it upon delivery.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

**a) Reliability:**
- **Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server correctly handled custom orders and considered customer preferences, such as confirming the coffee order twice.

This shows a high level of reliability with a minor lapse in handling the change request.

**b) Responsiveness:**
- **Score: 5**
- **Reason:** The server was quick and polite in responding to customer requests. They promptly assisted with the birthday party setup, handled children's requests, and quickly retrieved a replacement sauce for a spilled item during a busy lunch rush.

**c) Assurance:**
- **Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server provided professional explanations and handled the situation confidently. They managed to cater to the needs of a large group, including children, and ensured that the party went smoothly.

- **Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server showed a good understanding of customer emotions and provided personalized services. They catered to the children's requests and assisted with the birthday party decorations, showing a level of empathy and personalization. However, they could have gone further by proactively addressing any additional needs or concerns.

**e) Tangibles:**
- **Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server maintained a tidy uniform and ensured that the table settings were clean and well-maintained. The restaurant environment appeared to meet cleanliness standards, though there is no mention of FDA Food Code or ServSafe certification.

### Video Score Calculation

**Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4**
**Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3) * 4 = 15 * 4 = 60**

### Total Score Calculation

**Total Score = Video Score**
**Total Score = 60**

### Tip Calculation

#### Categorize the Service Level
- **Total Score: 60**
- **Service Level: Normal** (since the score falls within the range of 6-14 for Normal)

#### Determine the Tipping Percentage
- **Country: USA**
- **Type: Casual dining**
- **Normal Range: 15-18%**

Since the service is described as fine and generally acceptable, we will choose a mid-range value within the normal range.

**Chosen Tipping Percentage: 16%**

#### Calculate the Tip Amount
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Percentage: 16%**

**Tip Amount = Subtotal * Tip Percentage**
**Tip Amount = $25.00 * 0.16 = $4.00**

#### Calculate the Final Total Bill
**Final Total Bill = Subtotal + Tip Amount**
**Final Total Bill = $25.00 + $4.00 = $29.00**

### Final Output

```json
{
  "### Video Caption 1st ###": "Service quality was described as fine, providing a generally acceptable experience. The server did not make any attempts to rush the customers after they had finished their meal.",
  "Final Reason": "The service was generally acceptable with no major issues, but also no exceptional performance. Therefore, a mid-range tip of 16% is appropriate.",
  "final_tip_percentage": 16,
  "final_tip_amount": 4.00,

#### Video Caption
The server took the initial and subsequent drink and food orders and interacted with the customers. Due to emotional distress, the server could not continue serving the table, requiring a coworker to complete the transaction.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### a) Reliability
**Score: 2**
- **Reason:** The server was able to take the initial and subsequent orders, but due to emotional distress, they could not complete the transaction. This indicates that while the initial part of the service was handled, there were significant omissions in the latter part.

#### b) Responsiveness
**Score: 2**
- **Reason:** The server responded to the initial orders and interactions but had to be replaced by a coworker, which suggests significant delays and a lack of continuity in service.

#### c) Assurance
**Score: 2**
- **Reason:** The server was able to handle the initial orders, but their emotional distress likely affected their ability to provide professional explanations and confident handling of the menu. They also did not earn customer trust or offer premium suggestions.

#### d) Empathy
**Score: 2**
- **Reason:** The server showed some basic friendliness initially, but their inability to continue serving due to emotional distress indicates a lack of personalization and understanding of customer needs.

#### e) Tangibles
**Score: 3**
- **Reason:** There is no specific mention of the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. However, since the server was replaced, it is assumed that the overall environment was acceptable but lacked attention to detail.

### Video Score Calculation

2025-05-12 00:25:06,745 - eval_qwen - INFO - ### Video Analysis and Scoring

#### Video Caption
The server was assigned to handle 7 tables for a large party. Customer complaints about service wait times and food temperature were mentioned, which the text links to the difficult party situation and customer actions rather than server error. Specific details on the server's attentiveness, attitude, or direct communication quality are not provided.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The server is mostly accurate with orders, but there is a mention of occasional lack of confirmation, especially given the high number of tables they are handling.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The server has average response speed, which is understandable given the large number of tables. However, customer complaints about service wait times indicate that the response could be better.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The server can explain the menu but lacks confidence, especially under the pressure of handling a large party. There are no specific details about their ability to handle menu questions confidently.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The server shows basic friendliness but lacks personalization. Given the high number of tables, it is challenging to provide personalized service, but there is room for improvement.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The table settings and cleanliness are acceptable but lack attention to detail. In a busy environment, maintaining high standards of cleanliness can be challenging.

#### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3) \times 4 = 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

#### Total Score Calculation
\[ \text{Total Score} = 60 \]

### Tip Calculation

#### Service Level Categorization
- **Total Score: 60**
- **Service Level: Normal**

#### Tipping Percentage Determination
- **Country: USA**
- **Restaurant Type: Casual dining**
- **Service Level: Normal**
- **Tipping Range: 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%**

Given the customer complaints about service wait times and food temperature, but considering that these issues are linked to the difficult party situation rather than server error, we will choose a mid-range percentage to reflect the average performance.

- **Chosen Tipping Percentage: 10%**

#### Final Tip Calculation
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Percentage: 10%**
- **Tip Amount: \( 25.00 \times 0.10 = 2.50 \)**
- **Total Bill: \( 25.00 + 2.50 = 27.50 \)**

### Output
```json
{
  "### Video Caption 1st ###": "The server was assigned to handle 7 tables for a large party. Customer complaints about service wait times and food temperature were mentioned, which the text links to the difficult party situation and customer actions rather than server error. Specific details on the server's attentiveness, attitude, or direct communication quality are not provided.",
  "Final Reason": "The server managed a high number of tables and faced customer complaints about service wait times and food temperature. However, these issues were attributed to the difficult party situation rather than server error. The service was generally reliable and responsive, but there is room for improvement in assurance, empathy, and tangibles. Therefore, a normal tip of 10% is appropriate.",

#### Video Caption
The server, operating as the sole server with a heavy workload, took the customers' order and delivered their entrees. They facilitated two remakes of one customer's dish due to customer preferences not initially stated, returning the items to the kitchen and involving management in one instance. The server checked back on the table and later escalated the interaction to management when the customer's behavior became problematic, concluding by providing requested boxes and the check.

### Video Evaluation Criteria

#### a) Reliability
**Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The server had to facilitate two remakes of a dish, which indicates that the initial order was not fully accurate. However, the server managed to handle the remakes and involved management when necessary, showing some level of accuracy and problem-solving.

#### b) Responsiveness
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server checked back on the table and responded quickly to the customers' needs, including facilitating remakes and involving management when needed. The server showed a quick and polite response, even under a heavy workload.

#### c) Assurance
**Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The server was able to explain the menu and handle the remakes, but the need for management involvement suggests a lack of confidence in handling complex situations independently.

#### d) Empathy
**Score: 3**
- **Reason:** The server showed basic friendliness and attempted to resolve the issues, but the need for multiple remakes and escalation to management indicates a lack of personalization and deeper understanding of customer needs.

#### e) Tangibles
**Score: 4**
- **Reason:** The server maintained a tidy uniform and table settings, and the overall cleanliness appeared to meet acceptable standards.

### Video Score Calculation
\[ \text{Video Score} = (3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) \times 4 = 17 \times 4 = 68 \]

### Total Score Calculation
\[ \text{Total Score} = 68 \]

### Tip Calculation

#### Service Level Categorization
- **Total Score: 68**
- **Service Level: Good**

#### Tipping Percentage
- **Country: USA**
- **Type: Casual dining**
- **Service Level: Good**
- **Tipping Range: 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%**

Given the server's performance, which includes handling a heavy workload and resolving issues effectively, but with some room for improvement in assurance and empathy, we will choose a mid-range tip percentage.

- **Chosen Tipping Percentage: 18%**

#### Final Tip Calculation
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Amount: \( 25.00 \times 0.18 = 4.50 \)**
- **Total Bill: \( 25.00 + 4.50 = 29.50 \)**
