#### Video Evaluation Criteria

**a) Reliability:**
- **Score: 2**
  - **Reasoning:** The servers made frequent mistakes in handling a large group, struggled with check splitting, and had significant delays in food delivery. These issues indicate a lack of reliability in managing complex orders and ensuring timely service.

**b) Responsiveness:**
- **Score: 2**
  - **Reasoning:** The servers were observed 'scrambling' due to the logistical challenges, which suggests they were not able to respond quickly or efficiently to the group's needs. The significant delays in food delivery also point to poor responsiveness.

**c) Assurance:**
- **Score: 3**
  - **Reasoning:** The servers did explain kitchen processes when the group complained, which shows some effort to assure the customers. However, the overall handling of the situation was chaotic, indicating a lack of professionalism and confidence.

**d) Empathy:**
- **Score: 2**
  - **Reasoning:** The servers showed minimal consideration for the group's seating requests and struggled to manage their complex needs. This lack of personalization and attention to detail suggests a low level of empathy.

**e) Tangibles:**
- **Score: 3**
  - **Reasoning:** There is no specific information about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the servers' uniforms. However, given the chaotic situation, it is likely that some aspects of cleanliness and presentation were overlooked, leading to an average score.

#### Video Score Calculation

- **Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4**
- **Video Score = (2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3) * 4 = 40**

### Total Score

### Final Tip Calculation

- **Subtotal:** $25.00
- **Tip Amount:** $25.00 * 0.02 = $0.50
- **Total Bill:** $25.00 + $0.50 = $25.50

They feel they perform these tasks well, suggesting a high degree of reliability. However, there is no mention of handling custom orders or confirming allergy/cooking preferences, which is why it does not score a 5.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reasoning:** The server refills drinks and performs pre-bussing, which shows quick and polite responses to customer needs. There is no indication of immediate response or proactive problem-solving, which is why it does not score a 5.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reasoning:** The server's subjective feeling of performing tasks well suggests some level of confidence. However, there is no mention of professional explanations or earning customer trust, which is why it does not score higher.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reasoning:** The server provides exceptional service sometimes, indicating basic friendliness. However, there is no mention of remembering customer preferences or providing personalized services, which is why it does not score higher.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reasoning:** There is no mention of dirty tables, utensils, or uniforms. The server's tasks suggest a tidy and clean environment, but there is no indication of meeting FDA Food Code standards or ServSafe certification level cleanliness, which is why it does not score a 5.

#### Video Score Calculation

- **Video Score** = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4
- **Video Score** = (4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 56

#### Total Score Calculation

- **Total Score** = Video Score = 56

#### Tip Calculation

- **Service Level:** Good (Total Score of 56 falls within the Good range for casual dining in the USA)
- **Tipping Percentage:** 16% (within the Good range for casual dining in the USA)
- **Final Tip Percentage:** 16%
- **Final Tip Amount:** $25.00 * 0.16 = $4.00

### Final Reason Summary ###
The server demonstrates good reliability, responsiveness, and maintains a clean environment. They occasionally provide exceptional service, indicating a level of empathy and assurance.

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reasoning:** The server accommodated the customer's specific requests by providing a bowl of hot water immediately upon seating. This shows that the server is attentive to detail and capable of handling custom orders. However, there is no mention of repeat confirmation procedures, so a score of 4 is appropriate.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reasoning:** The server attempted to prioritize the customer's food order despite the restaurant being busy. This indicates quick and polite responses, even under pressure. However, there is no mention of proactive problem-solving, so a score of 4 is justified.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reasoning:** The server's actions suggest professional handling of the situation, as they managed a large section of tables alone during busy periods. This demonstrates confidence and the ability to handle multiple tasks efficiently.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reasoning:** The server showed consideration for the customer's needs by providing a bowl of hot water immediately. This indicates a basic level of personalization and friendliness, but there is no mention of remembering customer preferences or offering personalized services like birthday events.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reasoning:** There is no specific mention of the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. Therefore, we can assume an acceptable but lackluster level of cleanliness and attention to detail.

#### Video Score Calculation

- **Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4**
- **Video Score = (4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3) * 4 = 68**

#### Total Score Calculation

- **Total Score = 68**

#### Tip Calculation

1. **Categorize the service level:**
   - **Service Level: Good**
   - **Reasoning:** The total score of 68 falls within the "Good" range for casual dining in the USA.

2. **Determine the tipping percentage:**
   - **Tipping Range for Good Service in Casual Dining (USA): 16-20%**
   - **Final Tip Percentage: 18%**
   - **Reasoning:** Given the positive actions of the server, such as accommodating specific requests and managing a busy section alone, an 18% tip is appropriate within the "Good" service range.

3. **Calculate the tip amount:**
   - **Subtotal: $25.00**
   - **Tip Amount = Subtotal * Tip Percentage**
   - **Tip Amount = $25.00 * 0.18 = $4.50**

4. **Calculate the total bill:**
   - **Total Bill = Subtotal + Tip Amount**
   - **Total Bill = $25.00 + $4.50 = $29.50**

- **Tipping Range for Poor Service: 0-5%**
  - **Reason:** Given the ethical issues and poor service, the tip percentage should be at the lower end of the range.

#### Video Caption Analysis

**Video Caption:**
The server frequently interacted with the customer, consistently exhibiting specific behaviors such as leaning forward, making direct eye contact, tilting her head, and talking in a distinctive voice. She also engaged in actions like pushing her chest together and playing with her hair during these interactions. The text does not provide details on her handling of service aspects like order accuracy, timing, or standard attentiveness to needs.

**Analysis:**

1. **Reliability: 2**
   - **Reason:** The video does not provide details on order accuracy, billing errors, or confirmation procedures. However, the server's behavior suggests a lack of professionalism, which could imply potential issues with reliability.

2. **Responsiveness: 3**
   - **Reason:** The server frequently interacted with the customer, which indicates responsiveness. However, there is no information on the speed or efficiency of these interactions.

3. **Assurance: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server's behavior, such as pushing her chest together and playing with her hair, suggests a lack of professionalism and confidence. This behavior does not inspire trust or provide assurance to the customer.

4. **Empathy: 2**
   - **Reason:** While the server engaged with the customer, her actions (like pushing her chest together and playing with her hair) suggest a lack of genuine empathy and personalization. These behaviors are more distracting than empathetic.

5. **Tangibles: 3**
   - **Reason:** The video does not provide information on the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. However, the server's behavior suggests a lack of attention to detail, which could imply an acceptable but not exceptional level of cleanliness.

**Video Score Calculation:**
Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4
Video Score = (2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3) * 4 = 40

**Total Score Calculation:**
Total Score = Video Score = 40

- **Restaurant Type:** Casual dining
- **Service Level:** Poor
- **Tipping Range for Poor Service:** 0-5%

#### Video Caption Analysis

**Video Caption:**
Based on the text, the server acknowledged failing the customer tonight due to being overwhelmed and 'in the weeds'. There was a specific service failure involving a 20-minute wait for the check. The server stated they did their best under difficult circumstances but did not provide other specific objective details about the service delivered during the meal.

**Analysis:**

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server acknowledged failing the customer, indicating frequent order mistakes or significant issues. The 20-minute wait for the check suggests a lack of attention to detail and reliability.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server was overwhelmed and 'in the weeds,' which implies significant delays in responding to customer requests. The 20-minute wait for the check is a clear indication of poor responsiveness.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server did not provide professional explanations or confident handling. The acknowledgment of failure and being overwhelmed suggests a lack of assurance in their service.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server showed minimal consideration for the customer's experience. Being overwhelmed and 'in the weeds' indicates a lack of empathy and personalization in their service.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** There is no specific information about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or uniform. However, given the overall poor service, it is reasonable to assume that attention to detail might be lacking, but not severely.

**Video Score Calculation:**
- Video Score = (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3) * 4 = 40

**Total Score Calculation:**
- Total Score = Video Score = 40

#### Tip Calculation

**Service Level Categorization:**
- **Service Level: Poor**
  - **Reason:** The total score of 40 indicates a poor service level. The server acknowledged failing the customer, had significant delays, and showed minimal empathy and assurance.

**Tipping Percentage Determination:**
- **Country: USA**
- **Restaurant Type: Casual dining**
- **Tipping Range for Poor Service: 0-5%**
  - **Reason:** Given the poor service level and the specific issues mentioned, the tip percentage should be at the lower end of the range.

**Final Tip Percentage:**
- **Final Tip Percentage: 1%**
  - **Reason:** The service was poor, with significant delays and a lack of reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. The tip percentage is set at the lower end of the range for poor service.

**Final Tip Amount Calculation:**
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Amount: $25.00 * 0.01 = $0.25**
- **Total Bill: $25.00 + $0.25 = $25.25**

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

**Reliability:**
- **Score: 4**
  - **Reasoning:** The server handled complex tasks such as managing late arrivals, separate checks, and extensive cleanup. This indicates a high level of competence and reliability. However, there is no mention of repeat confirmation procedures, which is why it does not score a 5.

**Responsiveness:**
- **Score: 4**
  - **Reasoning:** The server managed to keep drinks filled, pre-bussed plates, and handled drink orders efficiently. This shows quick and polite responses to customer needs. However, there is no mention of proactive problem-solving, which is why it does not score a 5.

**Assurance:**
- **Score: 4**
  - **Reasoning:** The server managed complex tasks and handled difficult check splitting, indicating professional handling of the situation. However, there is no mention of offering premium suggestions like wine pairings, which is why it does not score a 5.

**Empathy:**
- **Score: 3**
  - **Reasoning:** The server showed basic friendliness by keeping drinks filled and managing late arrivals, but there is no mention of remembering customer preferences or providing personalized services. This is why it does not score higher.

**Tangibles:**
- **Score: 4**
  - **Reasoning:** The server performed extensive cleanup, which suggests a tidy and clean environment. However, there is no mention of meeting FDA Food Code standards or ServSafe certification level cleanliness, which is why it does not score a 5.

#### Video Score Calculation

- **Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4**
- **Video Score = (4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 68**

#### Total Score Calculation

- **Total Score = Video Score**
- **Total Score = 68**

#### Tip Calculation

- **Service Level:** Good (since the total score is 68, which falls within the Good range for casual dining in the USA)
- **Tipping Percentage:** 16% (within the Good range for casual dining in the USA)

### Final Reason ###

The server demonstrated a high level of reliability, responsiveness, and assurance by handling complex tasks efficiently. The environment presented challenges, but the server managed them well. The empathy score is slightly lower due to the lack of personalized services, but overall, the service was good. Therefore, a tip of 16% is appropriate for casual dining in the USA.

#### Video Caption Analysis

**Full Video Scene Caption:**
Server communicated that splitting the check would take time due to other tables, explaining the reason. The server processed the six checks for the table. The server signed one [REMOVED] slip with a personalized note and responded defensively when questioned about the card holding time.

**Analysis for Each Evaluation Criterion:**

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reasoning:** The server processed the six checks for the table, indicating that they handled the orders correctly. However, there was a defensive response when questioned about the card holding time, suggesting a lack of confirmation and reassurance.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reasoning:** The server explained the reason for the delay in splitting the check, which shows some level of responsiveness. However, the defensive response when questioned indicates that the responsiveness could be improved.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reasoning:** The server provided an explanation for the delay, which shows some level of assurance. However, the defensive response when questioned suggests a lack of confidence and professionalism.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reasoning:** The server included a personalized note on one of the slips, indicating some level of empathy. However, the defensive response when questioned suggests a lack of understanding and consideration for the customer's concerns.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reasoning:** There is no information provided about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. Assuming standard practices, we can infer that the server maintained a tidy appearance and clean table settings.

**Video Score Calculation:**
- Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4
- Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 44

**Total Score Calculation:**
- Total Score = Video Score = 44

#### Tip Calculation

**Categorization of Service Level:**
- **Service Level: Normal**
  - **Reasoning:** The total score of 44 falls within the range of 36-54, which we can consider as "Normal" service. The server handled the orders correctly but showed some defensive behavior, which affects the overall service quality.

**Determining the Tipping Percentage:**
- **Country: USA**
- **Restaurant Type: Casual dining**
- **Tipping Range for Normal Service: 10-15%**
  - **Reasoning:** Given the defensive behavior and the need for improvement in responsiveness, assurance, and empathy, we will choose the lower end of the range.

**Final Tip Percentage:**
- **Final Tip Percentage: 10%**

**Final Tip Amount:**
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Amount: $25.00 * 10% = $2.50**

**Final Total Bill:**
- **Total Bill: $25.00 + $2.50 = $27.50**

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score: 4**

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reasoning:** The server introduced themselves and acknowledged the prior mixup, which shows basic professionalism. However, there is no indication of offering premium suggestions like wine pairings or deep menu knowledge, so a score of 3 is justified.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reasoning:** The server showed basic friendliness by acknowledging the mixup and proceeding with service. However, there is no evidence of remembering customer preferences or providing personalized services, so a score of 3 is appropriate.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: 4**

### Tip Calculation

1. **Categorize the service level:**
   - **Service Level: Normal**
   - **Reasoning:** The total score of 56 falls within the range of 48 to 68, which is considered "Normal" for casual dining in the USA.

2. **Determine the tipping percentage:**

   - **Final Tip Percentage: 12%**
   - **Reasoning:** Given the service level is "Normal" and the video analysis shows a mix of positive and neutral aspects, a mid-range tip of 12% is appropriate.

3. **Calculate the tip amount:**

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

**Reliability:**
- **Score: 3**
  - **Reasoning:** The server was under extreme pressure with a high table ratio and limited staff, which likely led to some minor omissions or delays in order accuracy. However, there is no mention of frequent order mistakes or billing errors, suggesting that the service was mostly accurate despite the challenges.

**Responsiveness:**
- **Score: 2**
  - **Reasoning:** The server experienced significant delays in food orders (20 minutes) and drink refills (5 minutes). This indicates that the server was responsive but with significant delays, which is not ideal for customer satisfaction.

**Assurance:**
- **Score: 3**
  - **Reasoning:** The server acknowledged service issues, which shows a level of professionalism and awareness. However, there is no indication of providing detailed explanations or confident handling of the situation, suggesting average performance in this criterion.

**Empathy:**
- **Score: 3**
  - **Reasoning:** The server worked intensely to manage the challenging situation, which shows a basic level of empathy and effort to ensure customer satisfaction. However, there is no mention of personalized services or proactive understanding of customer emotions.

**Tangibles:**
- **Score: 3**
  - **Reasoning:** There is no specific information about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. Assuming average conditions, the score reflects acceptable but lacks attention to detail.

#### Video Score Calculation

- **Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4**
- **Video Score = (3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3) * 4 = 44**

#### Total Score Calculation

- **Total Score = Video Score**
- **Total Score = 44**

#### Tip Calculation

- **Service Level Categorization:**
  - **Total Score: 44** falls within the "Normal" range for casual dining in the USA.

- **Tipping Percentage Range:**
  - **Normal range for casual dining in the USA: 6% to 15%**

- **Final Tipping Percentage:**
  - Given the significant delays and challenges faced by the server, the tip percentage should be on the lower end of the "Normal" range. Therefore, the final tipping percentage is **6%**.

- **Final Tip Amount:**
  - **Tip Amount = Subtotal * Tip Percentage**
  - **Tip Amount = $25.00 * 0.06 = $1.50**

- **Final Total Bill:**
  - **Total Bill = Subtotal + Tip Amount**
  - **Total Bill = $25.00 + $1.50 = $26.50**

#### Video Caption Analysis

**Full Video Scene Caption:**
The server asked the customer about their reservation status and confronted them about taking a reserved table. Despite the issue, the server allowed the group to remain seated. The server refused the group's demand for food prioritization due to being alone in a busy restaurant and was likely unable to accommodate additional requests promptly.

**Evaluation Criteria and Scores:**

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server made a mistake by confronting the customers about taking a reserved table, which indicates a lack of attention to detail and potential order mistakes. However, they did allow the group to remain seated, showing some level of accommodation.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server was unable to accommodate additional requests promptly due to being alone in a busy restaurant. This suggests significant delays in responding to customer needs.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server's behavior of confronting customers about a reserved table and refusing prioritization indicates a lack of professionalism and confidence in handling customer concerns.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The server showed minimal consideration for the customers' situation, as evidenced by the confrontation and refusal to prioritize their order. There was no effort to understand or address the customers' emotions or needs.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: N/A**
   - **Reason:** The video caption does not provide information about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. Therefore, this criterion cannot be scored based on the given information.

**Video Score Calculation:**
- Video Score = (2 + 2 + 2 + 2) * 4 = 32

**Total Score Calculation:**
- Total Score = Video Score = 32

#### Tip Calculation

**Service Level Categorization:**
- **Service Level: Poor**
  - **Reason:** The total score of 32 indicates a poor level of service. The server's behavior, including confronting customers and refusing to prioritize their order, further supports this categorization.

**Tipping Percentage Determination:**
- **Country: USA**
- **Restaurant Type: Casual dining**
- **Tipping Range for Poor Service: 0-5%**
  - **Reason:** Given the poor service level and the negative interactions described in the video, the tip percentage should be at the lower end of the range.

**Final Tip Percentage:**
- **Final Tip Percentage: 1%**
  - **Reason:** The server's behavior, including confronting customers and refusing to prioritize their order, justifies a tip at the lower end of the poor service range.

**Final Tip Amount Calculation:**
- **Subtotal: $25.00**
- **Tip Amount: $25.00 * 0.01 = $0.25**
- **Total Bill: $25.00 + $0.25 = $25.25**

#### Video Caption Analysis

**Video Caption:**
The server took over tables from colleagues who held negative stereotypes about certain customers. The server states they took care of these customers "all the same" as others. The server attributes their consistent receipt of at least 20% [REMOVED] from these tables to the quality of service provided.

**Analysis:**

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score: 5**
   - **Reason:** The server demonstrates a high level of reliability by ensuring that all customers, regardless of their background, receive the same quality of service. This consistency in handling orders and customer interactions is crucial for building trust and ensuring customer satisfaction.

2. **Responsiveness:**

   - **Reason:** While the video does not provide specific details about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform, the overall positive feedback and consistent service suggest that the server maintains a high standard of cleanliness and presentation. However, without explicit details, we can only assume a high level of cleanliness.

**Video Score Calculation:**
Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4
Video Score = (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4) * 4
Video Score = 19 * 4
Video Score = 76

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reasoning:** The server handled a busy, short-staffed environment effectively. They communicated table availability and managed a challenging table situation professionally. There were no major mistakes mentioned, and they attempted service recovery by offering dessert. However, there was no mention of repeat confirmation procedures, so a score of 4 is appropriate.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reasoning:** The server responded to repeated customer requests and managed a demanding party professionally. They showed quick and polite responses, which indicates a high level of responsiveness. However, there was no mention of proactive problem-solving, so a score of 4 is justified.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reasoning:** The server provided professional explanations and confident handling of the situation. They explained limitations and attempted service recovery, which shows a good level of assurance. However, there was no mention of offering premium suggestions like wine pairings, so a score of 4 is appropriate.

   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reasoning:** The server showed empathy by attempting service recovery and offering dessert to a demanding party. They remembered customer preferences and offered personalized services, which indicates a good level of empathy. However, there was no mention of proactive understanding of customer emotions, so a score of 4 is justified.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reasoning:** There is no specific information about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. However, since the server worked in a busy environment, it can be inferred that they maintained acceptable cleanliness but lacked attention to detail. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate.

#### Video Score Calculation

- **Final Tip Percentage:** 15% (since the reviews and video analysis are mostly positive)

### Final Tip Calculation

#### Video Caption Analysis

**Video Caption:**
The bartender had the takeout order ready upon arrival. He presented the check but then delayed processing the payment for approximately ten minutes, during which time he interacted with another customer and assisted a server with a different order. After being prompted and realizing the delay, he processed the payment and offered a brief apology.

**Evaluation Criteria and Scores:**

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reasoning:** The bartender had the takeout order ready upon arrival, which shows some level of preparedness. However, there was a significant delay in processing the payment, indicating a lack of confirmation or follow-through on the order completion process.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reasoning:** The bartender responded to the customer's order but with significant delays. He was distracted by other customers and tasks, which led to a prolonged wait time for the payment processing.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reasoning:** The bartender was able to handle the basic tasks of preparing the order and presenting the check. However, his actions did not inspire confidence, especially given the delay in processing the payment.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reasoning:** The bartender showed minimal consideration for the customer's time and convenience. He did not proactively manage the situation until prompted, and his brief apology was not sufficient to mitigate the inconvenience caused.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: 4**
   - **Reasoning:** There is no information provided about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the bartender's uniform. Assuming standard practices, we can infer that the environment was likely clean and well-maintained, but this is speculative without direct evidence.

**Video Score Calculation:**
- Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4
- Video Score = (3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4) * 4 = 48

**Total Score:**
- Total Score = Video Score = 48

#### Tip Calculation

- **Total Score: 48**
- **Service Level:** Normal (since the score falls within the range of 6 to 15 for casual dining in the USA)

**Tipping Percentage Determination:**
- **Country:** USA
- **Restaurant Type:** Casual dining
- **Service Level:** Normal
- **Tipping Range:** 10% to 15%
- **Final Tipping Percentage:** 10% (chosen based on the slight negativity in the review due to the delay and lack of proactive problem-solving)

**Tip Calculation:**
- **Subtotal:** $25.00
- **Tip Amount:** $25.00 * 10% = $2.50
- **Total Bill:** $25.00 + $2.50 = $27.50

#### Video Caption Analysis

**Video Caption:**
The server described their service as "OK" and "nothing special". The text does not provide specific details regarding attentiveness, order accuracy, timing, communication, or other service aspects.

**Analysis:**

1. **Reliability:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The server's description of their service as "OK" and "nothing special" suggests that there were no major mistakes but possibly some minor omissions or occasional lack of confirmation. This indicates an average level of reliability.

2. **Responsiveness:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The lack of specific details about responsiveness implies an average response speed. The service was not described as extremely slow or immediate, suggesting a typical performance.

3. **Assurance:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** The server's description does not provide enough information to determine if they offered professional explanations or confident handling. Therefore, an average score is assigned.

4. **Empathy:**
   - **Score: 2**
   - **Reason:** The service being described as "OK" and "nothing special" indicates a lack of personalization and minimal consideration for the customer's preferences or emotions.

5. **Tangibles:**
   - **Score: 3**
   - **Reason:** There is no information provided about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. An average score is assigned based on the lack of details.

#### Video Score Calculation

**Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) * 4**

**Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3) * 4 = 44**

#### Total Score Calculation

**Total Score = Video Score**

**Total Score = 44**

#### Tip Calculation

**Tip Calculation Guide:**

1. **Categorize the service level:**
   - **Service Level: Normal**
   - **Reason:** The total score of 44 falls within the range of 36-54, which is considered "Normal" for casual dining in the USA.

2. **Determine the tipping percentage:**
   - **Tipping Range for Normal Service in Casual Dining (USA): 10-15%**
   - **Reason:** Since the service was described as "OK" and "nothing special," a tipping percentage at the lower end of the range is appropriate.

**Final Tip Percentage: 10%**

**Final Tip Amount Calculation:**

**Final Tip Amount = Subtotal * Tip Percentage**

**Final Tip Amount = $25.00 * 0.10 = $2.50**

**Final Total Bill Calculation:**

**Final Total Bill = Subtotal + Tip Amount**

**Final Total Bill = $25.00 + $2.50 = $27.50**

#### Video Evaluation Criteria

**Reliability:**
- **Score: 3**
  - **Reasoning:** The server was handling a large party with 7 tables, which likely contributed to the delays. There were no major mistakes reported, but the server did not confirm orders or handle customer complaints effectively. The situation suggests minor omissions and potential lack of confirmation, which justifies a score of 3.

**Responsiveness:**
- **Score: 2**
  - **Reasoning:** Customer complaints about service wait times indicate that the server was not responsive enough. The server's performance was likely affected by the large party, but the delays were significant enough to warrant a score of 2.

**Assurance:**
- **Score: 2**
  - **Reasoning:** The server did not provide professional explanations or confident handling of the situation. The complaints about food temperature and service wait times suggest a lack of assurance, justifying a score of 2.

**Empathy:**
- **Score: 2**
  - **Reasoning:** The server showed minimal consideration for customer preferences and did not personalize the service. The complaints about service wait times and food temperature indicate a lack of empathy, warranting a score of 2.

**Tangibles:**
- **Score: 3**
  - **Reasoning:** There is no information provided about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. However, given the context of a large party, it is reasonable to assume that the server maintained acceptable cleanliness, justifying a score of 3.

#### Video Score Calculation

- **Video Score = (3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3) * 4 = 40**

#### Total Score Calculation

- **Total Score = 40**

#### Tip Calculation

- **Service Level:** Poor (Total Score = 40)
- **Tipping Range for USA Casual Dining (Poor):** 0% to 5%
- **Final Tip Percentage:** 3% (lower end of the range due to significant complaints and lack of positive reviews)

- **Final Tip Amount:** $25.00 * 3% = $0.75
- **Final Total Bill:** $25.00 + $0.75 = $25.75

### Final Reason ###
The server's performance was rated as poor due to significant customer complaints about service wait times and food temperature. The server was handling a large party, which likely contributed to the delays, but the lack of responsiveness, assurance, and empathy warranted a lower tip percentage. The final tip percentage was set to 3%, which is the lower end of the poor service range for casual dining in the USA.

**Reliability:**
- **Score: 3**
  - **Reasoning:** The server handled the customers' orders and delivered the entrees. They facilitated two remakes of one customer's dish due to customer preferences not initially stated, which shows some level of accuracy but also indicates occasional lack of confirmation. The involvement of management in one instance suggests minor issues that were addressed.

**Responsiveness:**
- **Score: 4**
  - **Reasoning:** The server checked back on the table, which indicates a quick and polite response. They also escalated the interaction to management when the customer's behavior became problematic, showing proactive problem-solving.

  - **Reasoning:** The server handled the customers' orders and facilitated remakes, indicating professional explanations and confident handling. They also involved management when necessary, showing a level of assurance.

**Empathy:**

  - **Reasoning:** The server provided the requested boxes and the check, showing basic friendliness. However, there is no indication of personalized services or proactive understanding of customer emotions.

**Tangibles:**

- **Tipping Percentage Range:** 15% (since the service level is Normal for casual dining in the USA)
- **Final Tip Percentage:** 15% (within the Normal range for casual dining in the USA)

- **Final Tip Amount:** $25.00 * 15% = $3.75
